# Roadmap

> Note: The canonical high-level plan is maintained here: [Canonical Roadmap â€” 1% Treaty â†’ DIH â†’ dFDA](../roadmap.md). This page is an older, DAO-focused roadmap retained for historical context and tactical details.

For the endâ€‘toâ€‘end plan, see the [Canonical Roadmap â€” 1% Treaty â†’ DIH â†’ dFDA](../roadmap.md).

So, roughly the process would be:
ðŸ‘‰ $1M to initially create the DAO
ðŸ‘‰ $40M from token crowdfunding
ðŸ‘‰ $20M Lobbying + $20M Marketing to Get Signatures from 1%
ðŸ‘‰ $20B/year funding
ðŸ‘‰ If necessary, pay back initial contributors, with 0.5% of the $20B
ðŸ‘‰ 260X Faster Medical Progress and 1% Less War
ðŸ‘‰ [$179T](1-percent-treaty.md) Equivalent Economic Value of Less War and Disease

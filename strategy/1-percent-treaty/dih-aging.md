## Mission

Accelerate the prevention and reversal of age-related decline by coordinating aging/longevity communities, launching decentralized trials on the dFDA platform, and mobilizing institutional endorsements for the 1% Treaty referendum.

## Scope

- Biological aging hallmarks and related diseases (frailty, cognitive decline, sarcopenia, metabolic dysfunction)
- Priority programs: longitudinal registries, rapid pragmatic trials, biomarker standards, and cross-institute collaboration (Neuro, Metabolic, Women’s Health)

## Roles & Titles

- Institute Chair (1-year term, renewable once)
- Fellows / Founding Fellows
- Ambassadors (regional/domain)
- Affiliate Partners (org-level)
- Ad hoc Expert Reviewers (credentialed; auto-selected per proposal)

Appointments are criteria-based with public COI disclosures; titles are honorary/programmatic, not regulatory.

## Interfaces

- dFDA Platform: trial templates for aging endpoints; outcome ranking integration
- DIH Cross-Cutting: Data/Interop (standards), Safety (pharmacovigilance), AI/Methods (adaptive designs), Treasury (subsidies)
- On-chain modules: grants/QF rounds, outcome bounties, patient subsidies; institute wallet with role-bound credentials
- Oracles: evidence (ranked outcomes), identity/COI attestations, safety incident feed; public attestation registry

## Operations

- No standing meetings; asynchronous, timeboxed reviews with on-chain execution
- KPIs and OKRs auto-computed from data/oracles; public dashboards replace reports

## Initial OKRs (draft)

- Secure 25+ org endorsements for the 1% Treaty within two quarters
- Launch 3 priority decentralized trials (e.g., exercise protocol, nutritional intervention, repurposed safe compounds) with ≥500 total participants
- Publish a minimal biomarker and outcomes standard for aging trials used across ≥2 institutes

## Success Metrics

- Referendum signatures mobilized, trials launched, participants subsidized, evidence produced (ranked outcomes), savings redeemed, incident rate/time-to-mitigation, standard adoption, and clinical/community partnerships formed

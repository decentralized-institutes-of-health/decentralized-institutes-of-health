**To: Our Elected Representatives, Policymakers, and Leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**

## BUG REPORTS

* **95% of diseases still have no FDA-approved treatments.**
* Patients often endure **17 years of suffering** from the discovery of a new treatment until it actually reaches them.
* Up to **85% of patients are excluded** from participating in clinical trials under current models.

By upgrading FDA.gov to automate the pragmatic trial approach of the Oxford Recovery Trial, Transforming the system has the potential for an **80X acceleration in medical progress** reducing the cost of medical research from $48k/patient to $500/patient.

To do this, we must OPEN-SOURCE FDA.GOV so anyone can improve it and implement the great features below:

## Feature Requests

### I. For Research Partners/Pharma/Trial Sponsors

* **1. Create a Trial:** Provide an intuitive interface to upload protocols, pre/post-clinical data, and register supply chains, supported by simple protocol builders with templates, automated regulatory compliance checks, and secure data storage.
* **2. Get Liability Insurance:** Enable systems to automatically receive and select competitive liability insurance quotes per subject with transparent, risk-based pricing and one-click policy activation.
* **3. Set Pricing/Participant:** Allow researchers to flexibly define patient pricing, required data collection points (e.g., blood glucose, weight, activity, diet), and refundable deposit/incentive structures.
* **4. Manage Supply Chain & Orders:** Implement tools for end-to-end visibility to track inventory, fulfill patient orders securely, monitor temperature-controlled shipping, and utilize blockchain-verified chain of custody.
* **5. Analyze Trial Data:** Offer access to real-time insights via comprehensive dashboards, including tools for monitoring treatment effectiveness, participant compliance, advanced statistical analysis, and preparation for regulatory submissions.

### II. For Patients

* **1. Enter Your Condition:** Simply input the condition that's making you miserable.
* **2. View Ranked Treatments:** See a ranked list of the most safe and effective treatments based on the entire universe of clinical and real-world data.
* **3. Join Clinical Trials from Home:** Instantly enroll in decentralized trials for promising treatments that interest you.
* **4. Get Treatment Delivered:** Get treatments delivered to your pharmacy or physician and schedule necessary lab tests automatically.
* **5. Effortlessly Report Outcomes:** Report treatment effects easily through your preferred apps, EHR systems, or automated calls.

**Until we implement these features and fix these bugs, over a billion people will continue suffer.**

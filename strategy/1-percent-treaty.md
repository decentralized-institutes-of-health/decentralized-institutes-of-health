## Facts:

1. **2 billion people suffer** from chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and many others. This causes immense human anguish as well as crippling economic costs.
2. **Medical research** to find cures for these diseases remains far **too slow** to meet the desperate needs of patients.
3. **Advanced data analysis and automation** can radically accelerate the clinical research process by automating analysis of medical data, identifying promising drug targets, optimizing clinical trial designs, and more.
4. A global collaborative effort to automate clinical research, coordinated and governed by the people, could produce revolutionary breakthroughs against chronic diseases and **alleviate the suffering of billions of people.**

## Logical Proof:

Here is the logical proof that signing this accord is the most rational thing you can do with the next few moments of your life:

1. Governments currently spend over $2 trillion per year on their militaries. They don't do this because they like blowing up other people and their stuff. They do this to maintain the balance of power against other nations that might blow them up.

2. However, if every nation agreed to reallocate just 1% of their annual military expenditures to a global medical research fund:
- The relative balance of power would remain unchanged. So, despite spending less on the military, they would be at no greater relative risk of being murdered by another country.
- The entire world would benefit from the resulting health advances and cures for diseases.

3. Therefore, it is clearly in your rational self-interest to sign this treaty requesting that all nations to cooperate in this endeavor. By contributing a infinitesimal portion of their military budgets, they can help unlock revolutionary health benefits for their own citizens and the world at large.

## How it Works:

1. Every participating nation will pledge **1% of its annual military budget** to the [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](../legal.md) treasury. This creates a sustainable revenue stream to repay bondholders who fund the war on disease and to continuously finance the dFDA ecosystem. <!-- TODO: Add link to dih-technical-architecture.md once created. -->
2. The **DIH will use its treasury to subsidize patient participation** in dFDA trials that are **80X more efficient** than traditional models, a benchmark already proven by the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](../reference/recovery-trial-case-study.md). The fund will also support infrastructure development and offer bounties for medical innovation, with allocation determined by an algorithm that prioritizes research with the highest expected value to society.
3. The DIH treasury is initially funded by selling **VICTORY Bonds** to the public, allowing research and subsidies to begin immediately. The contributions from nations via the 1% Treaty are then used to repay these bonds over time. See [VICTORY Bonds â€” Incentive Mechanics](../economics/investment-thesis.md). <!-- TODO: Link to a more detailed tokenomics file when created. -->
4. The governance of the treasury for functions like prize and bounty allocation is managed through a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, ensuring community alignment and transparency.
5. All research findings and data generated through the dFDA protocol, which is supported by the DIH, will be made openly available in real-time to the global scientific community, **accelerating progress** and enabling rapid translation of discoveries into new medicines and improved clinical practices worldwide.
6. Participating nations and research institutions will collaborate continuously through a state-of-the-art online platform, sharing knowledge, best practices, and resources to **maximize the impact of every research dollar** and speed the deployment of new health solutions to patients everywhere.

By combining innovative financial instruments like VICTORY Bonds and global cooperation, we can transform the fight against chronic disease. The resulting breakthroughs will improve health, extend lives, boost economies, and benefit every nation on Earth.

# Cost of War

The direct and indirect costs of war come out to [$74,259](../reference/costs-of-war.md) per person over an 80-year lifespan.

# Cumulative Savings from Decreased Annual Cost of War

Reducing spending on war by 1% annually would reduce the per-person costs by [$22,969](../economics/peace-dividend-value-capture.md) over an 80-year lifespan.

# Cost of Disease

The [**$244 trillion**](../economics/cost-of-disease.md) total global annual cost of disease is a comprehensive measure that encompasses direct healthcare costs, indirect economic losses, and the $100k valuation of a Year of Life Lost (YLL) and a $100k valuation Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALYs).

# Redirecting 1% of Military Spending to Healthcare Innovation

By redirecting just 1% of war spending each year to accelerate clinical research through data-driven and decentralized methods over 80 years, we would save lives, reduce disability, and significantly impact the global economy. The monetary benefit of this shift would be approximately [$1,235,443](../economics/quantitative-value-medical-treatment.md) per person over 80 years.

# Total Net Benefit of Less War and More Cures

The total combined per capita net benefit of redirecting 1% of military spending to healthcare innovation over 80 years would be [$1,258,412](../economics/quantitative-value-medical-treatment.md).

This is calculated by adding the [$22,969](../economics/peace-dividend-value-capture.md) savings from decreased annual cost of war to the [$1,235,443](../economics/quantitative-value-medical-treatment.md) benefit of reducing the burden of chronic disease.

# $1,258,412 for 5 Hours of Your Time

Historical examples show that movements with active support from over **3.5% of the population** have never failed to lead to systemic change.

So all you have to do is convince a small fraction of your friends to sign this treaty and convince them to convince a small fraction of their friends to sign this treaty and so on.

Given the average number of friends (150) and the estimated time per friend (2 minutes), an average person would need to invest approximately [5 hours](../strategy/global-referendum/global-referendum-viral-marketing.md) to individually reach out to all 150 of their friends via personal messages or emails about the treaty.

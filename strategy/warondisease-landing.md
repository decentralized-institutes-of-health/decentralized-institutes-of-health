# Optimal Landing Page Structure: War on Disease

## I. HOOK & CORE PITCH (Hero Section)
   - Visual impact: "What if you could eradicate disease, end war, and get filthy rich simultaneously?"
   - Core thesis: Make curing people more profitable than killing them
   - Key stat: $2.72T military vs $67.5B medical research (40X disparity)

## II. THE PROBLEM (Establish Stakes)
   - Concrete costs of current misallocation
   - Pentagon waste examples ($2.5T unaccounted)
   - Health threats vs military threats (pandemics kill more than wars)
   - The insanity of nuclear overkill while diseases ravage families

## III. THE SOLUTION (Simple & Clear)
   - The 1% Treaty: redirect 1% of military → health
   - Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) treasury model
   - 80X more efficient trials (RECOVERY vs NIH RECOVER example)
   - Global referendum → treaty → funding

## IV. THE FINANCIAL ENGINE (Why This Works)
   - VICTORY bonds: 40% CAGR investment vehicle
   - Peace dividend capture: $27B annual treasury
   - Mathematical proof: $1B investment → $29B return from $270B income
   - Financing structure and return principles

## V. THE BRIBERY STRATEGY (How Everyone Wins)
   - Phase 1: Seed Investors (>40% CAGR returns)
   - Phase 2: VICTORY Bond Buyers (governance + returns)
   - Phase 3: Citizens (VOTE points for referendum participation)
   - Phase 4: Politicians (campaign support + personal wealth)
   - Phase 5: Military Contractors (co-opt, don't fight)

## VI. PROOF & PRECEDENTS (Why This Isn't Insane)
   - Historical examples: WWII war bonds, 3.5% rule, landmine treaty
   - Proven technology: DAO governance, decentralized trials
   - Conservative assumptions and risk mitigation
   - Partial success scenarios still profitable

## VII. OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES (Address Skepticism)
   - **Consolidated section** covering major objections:
     - Free rider problem
     - Legal compliance
     - Scale verification
     - Execution risk
     - Political feasibility
   - Each with clear, factual rebuttals

## VIII. SECURITY & GOVERNANCE (Building Trust)
   - Anti-corruption mechanisms
   - Transparency and auditability
   - DAO governance model
   - Multi-layered fraud detection

## IX. CALL TO ACTION (Clear Next Steps)
   - Personal investment calculator
   - Referendum participation links
   - Institution partnership opportunities
   - Contact information for different stakeholder types

## X. APPENDIX (Supporting Details)
   - Implementation roadmap summary
   - Key parameter sources
   - Links to detailed technical docs

# ðŸ’° Improving Treatment Affordability and Accessibility

The proposed decentralized FDA (dFDA) system would transform both the affordability and accessibility of medical treatments for patients through multiple reinforcing mechanisms. This article synthesizes the economic analyses demonstrating how these benefits would emerge if the dFDA framework were implemented.

## Key Affordability Improvements

### 1. Substantial Drug Price Reductions (30%-70%)

The proposed dFDA system would create significant downward pressure on drug prices through several mechanisms:

- **R&D Cost Reduction**: Cutting trial costs by 95% would reduce overall drug development costs by 50-65%
- **Increased Competition**: More market entrants due to lower barriers to entry
- **Validation of Off-Patent Alternatives**: Cheaper or off-patent compounds could compete with brand-name drugs

| Price Reduction Factor | Projected Impact Range | Notes |
|------------------------|--------------|-------|
| Base Cost Reduction | 30-50% | Direct result of lower R&D costs |
| Competition Effect | Additional 20-40% | New entrants would force prices down |
| Off-Patent Alternatives | Varies by therapeutic area | Could dramatically reduce prices in some categories |

Based on economic modeling of the proposed dFDA system, the price reduction effect could generate **$200-$500 billion in annual savings globally** on prescription medications.

> Source: [Global prescription drug spending](https://www.statista.com/statistics/280572/medicine-spending-worldwide/) is approximately $1.4 trillion annually, with 60-80% on brand/patented products.

For a complete analysis of potential drug price reductions, see [Lower Drug Prices](/benefits/lower-drug-prices.md) and the comprehensive [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](/economic-models/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.md).

### 2. Earlier Access to Treatments (7 Years Sooner)

Under the proposed system, patients would gain access to potentially life-saving treatments after Phase 1 safety testing rather than waiting for the traditional approval process:

- **Current System**: Average 10+ years from discovery to patient access
- **Proposed dFDA System**: Access would be possible after Phase 1 safety (approximately 3 years)
- **Projected Time Savings**: Approximately 7 years earlier access

This acceleration would not only save lives but would reduce the financial burden of managing diseases while waiting for better treatments to become available.

For detailed analysis of projected time-to-treatment benefits, see the [Time to Treatment](/benefits/time-to-treatment.md) document.

### 3. Shift Toward Cures vs. Lifetime Symptom Management

The traditional pharmaceutical economic model favors ongoing symptom management over one-time cures:

- **Current Problem**: Lifetime treatments are more profitable than cures
- **Proposed dFDA Solution**: Lower development costs would make one-time cures economically viable
- **Potential Patient Benefit**: Avoiding lifetime medication costs for chronic conditions

For more on this critical economic shift, read [More Cures and Less Lifelong Attempts at Masking Symptoms](/benefits/more-cures-and-less-lifelong-attempts-at-masking-symptoms.md).

## Key Accessibility Improvements

### 1. Removing Geographic Barriers

Traditional clinical trials exclude approximately 85% of potential participants due to:

- Limited trial locations
- Travel requirements
- Geographic constraints

The proposed dFDA's decentralized approach would enable:

- **Remote Participation**: Join trials from anywhere
- **Removal of Location Barriers**: No need to live near research centers
- **Global Inclusion**: Participants from diverse geographic regions

For comprehensive discussion on potential patient participation improvements, see [Patient Participation](/benefits/patient-participation.md).

### 2. Treatments for Smaller Patient Populations

When trials would cost approximately 5% of current levels:

- **Rare Disease Focus**: Smaller patient populations would become economically viable targets
- **Patient-Led Research**: Nonprofit and patient groups could fund research for ultra-rare conditions
- **Market Expansion**: Expected 10-20% increase in approvals for previously underserved conditions

The full analysis of projected cost savings that would enable these improvements is available in [Lower Costs](/benefits/lower-costs.md) and [Cost Savings from Decentralized Clinical Trials](/benefits/cost-savings-from-decentralized-clinical-trials.md).

### 3. More Personalized Treatment Matching

The proposed dFDA system's global data network would enable:

- 20% average improvement in treatment outcomes through better matching
- Precise identification of which treatments work for specific patient subtypes
- Reduction in trial-and-error prescribing that wastes time and money

## Projected Economic Impact Summary

| Benefit Category | Projected Annual Value (Global) | Potential Direct Patient Impact |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Trial Cost Savings | $266B | Lower drug prices |
| Earlier Access | $840B | Life extension, improved quality of life |
| Drug Price Reductions | $250B+ | Direct out-of-pocket savings |
| Treatments for Underserved Markets | $10B+ | Access to previously unavailable therapies |
| **Total Projected Annual Benefit** | **$1.37T** | **Transformative improvement in care access and affordability** |

For the complete economic model with detailed calculations of these projections, see [Overall Economic Benefits](/benefits/overall-economic-benefits.md).

## Potential Real-World Patient Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Chronic Disease Management

**Current System**: A patient with a chronic condition might spend $50,000+ over a lifetime on symptom management
**Proposed dFDA System**: Either significantly reduced ongoing treatment costs (30-70% lower) or potential access to curative therapies that were previously economically unfeasible to develop

### Scenario 2: Rare Disease Patient

**Current System**: No approved treatments due to small market size and high development costs
**Proposed dFDA System**: Previously "unprofitable" rare disease treatments would become viable through drastically reduced development costs

### Scenario 3: Severe Condition Requiring New Treatment

**Current System**: 10+ year wait for new treatment approval while condition progresses
**Proposed dFDA System**: Access to promising treatments after Phase 1 safety (approximately 3 years), potentially adding years of productive life

## Conclusion

The proposed dFDA system would address both the affordability and accessibility challenges that currently limit patient access to optimal care:

1. **Affordability improvements** through projected dramatic reductions in drug prices (30-70%), enabled by lower development costs and increased competition

2. **Accessibility improvements** through:
   - Earlier access to treatments (7 years sooner)
   - Global participation regardless of location
   - Development of treatments for previously neglected conditions
   - Better treatment matching through comprehensive data

These combined effects would represent a paradigm shift in patient access to treatments, with annual economic benefits potentially exceeding $1 trillion globally while dramatically improving health outcomes and quality of life for patients worldwide.

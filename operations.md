# ðŸ“– Chapter 7: Building the Organization

The DIH is not a typical organization, and it will not be built by a typical team. Our operational philosophy is designed for a singular purpose: to build a self-sustaining, decentralized protocol for global good, and then get out of the way.

## The Philosophy: A Temporary Activation Team

We are not building a large, permanent bureaucracy. We are building a small, elite **"activation team"** whose sole mission is to bootstrap the DIH and then make themselves obsolete.

This requires a clear distinction between core and tactical functions:

-   **Core Functions (Internal Team):** The permanent brain trust. A small, core team will handle strategy, leadership, political maneuvering, legal architecture, and product vision.
-   **Tactical Execution (Outsourced & Decentralized):** All other functionsâ€”software development, media production, specialized analysisâ€”will be handled by world-class agencies, contractors, and eventually, the decentralized community itself through grants and bounties.

The team's ultimate measure of success is the creation of a system that no longer needs them.

## Compensation: Alignment by Design

To maintain deep alignment with the mission, the core team's compensation is heavily weighted towards the long-term success of the project.

-   **Salaries:** Modest, market-rate cash salaries to cover living expenses.
-   **Incentives:** Large, vested grants of **[VICTORY instruments](./economics.md)**.

This preserves the treasury for high-leverage political and technical spending while ensuring that the team's personal financial success is directly and inextricably linked to the success of the 1% Treaty.

## The Phased Hiring Roadmap

The activation team will be assembled in phases, scaling only as the mission achieves key milestones.

### Phase 0: The Founding Team (Months 0-3)

**Goal:** Assemble the 3 core leads with pre-seed funding to execute the main capital raise and global campaign.
-   **[Capital Markets Lead](./careers/capital-markets-lead.md):** Structure the VICTORY bonds, build the comprehensive financial model and data room, and lead the subsequent seed and Series A fundraising efforts.
-   **Elections & IE Compliance Lead:** A legal and political expert responsible for designing the legally-compliant framework for the global referendum and the multi-jurisdictional independent expenditure (IE) strategy.
-   **Growth & Referrals Lead:** A product and growth leader responsible for designing the technology, incentive structure, and viral referral mechanics of the global referendum platform and VOTE points system.

### Phase 1: The Seed Team (Headcount: ~20)

**Goal:** With seed funding secured, build the foundational leadership and technical teams to launch the global campaign.
-   **Leadership:** CEO, COO, CTO, Chief Strategy Officer, General Counsel.
-   **Core Functions:** Heads of Product, Design, Community, and Political Strategy.

### Phase 2: The Scale-Up Team (Headcount: ~50-75)

**Goal:** As the global referendum gains momentum, scale the team to support hundreds of millions of users and a full-scale political operation.
-   **Key Hires:** Head of Security, Data Science team, and expanded engineering and political staff.

### Phase 3: The Protocol Team (Headcount: ~75-100)

**Goal:** With the treaty ratified, transition to a team focused on managing the multi-billion dollar DIH treasury and facilitating decentralized governance.
-   **Key Hires:** CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Head of Governance / DAO Facilitator, and Treasury Operations.

This lean, phased approach ensures that we remain agile, efficient, and relentlessly focused on the mission at every stage.

# Operational Budget & Financial Model Documentation

This document provides the detailed, bottom-up justification for the figures presented in the main [Fundraising & Budget Plan](./fundraising-and-budget-plan.md). It is intended to serve as the primary resource for investor diligence.

**Note on the Financial Model:** This document is the strategic companion to a detailed, spreadsheet-based financial model, which is available upon request. A placeholder for this model can be found at [`financial-model-placeholder.csv`](./financial-model-placeholder.csv). The spreadsheet includes monthly cash flow projections, a full cap table, and sensitivity analysis.

## 1. Founding Team & Hiring Plan

A plan is only as good as the team executing it. Our strategy is to maintain a lean, world-class core team and supplement with contractors and prize-based competition. For a detailed breakdown of the phase-based hiring roadmap and role descriptions, see the full [**Hiring Plan & Team Roadmap**](../careers/hiring-plan.md).

*   **Founding Team:** The core team will consist of 15-20 individuals with deep expertise in large-scale software engineering, international law, political campaigning, and crypto-economics. (Detailed bios are available in the investor data room).
*   **Hiring Roadmap:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Seed):** Core leadership is in place. Key hires include a General Counsel, a Head of Platform Engineering, and a Head of Political Strategy. Total headcount: ~20.
    *   **Phase 2 (Series A):** Scale the team to support global operations. Key hires include Regional Campaign Directors (North America, Europe, Asia) and a Head of Security. Total headcount: ~50.
    *   **Phase 3 (Growth):** Full operational staff to manage the DIH treasury and global compliance. Key hires include a Chief Financial Officer and a Chief Compliance Officer. Total headcount: ~75-100.
*   **Compensation Philosophy:** All core team members will receive modest, market-rate cash salaries combined with large, vested grants of VICTORY bonds. This aligns incentives and preserves cash.

## 2. Bottom-Up Budget Justification

The following provides a more granular justification for the phase-based budget.

### **Phase 1: Seed ($250M - $400M)**

| Category | Estimate | Bottom-Up Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operations** | $10-15M | Based on a team of 20 with a fully-loaded average cost of $250k/year for a 2-year runway. |
| **Platform MVP** | $50-75M | Includes a 50-person engineering team/contractor budget, plus 3 independent security audits ($5M), and cloud infrastructure costs ($10M). |
| **Legal (Pilots)** | $40-60M | Based on retaining 5 top-tier global law firms ($5M/year each) and 3 lobbying firms ($5M/year each) for a 2-year period. |
| **Pilot IE** | $100-150M | Derived from the average cost of a competitive U.S. Senate campaign (~$50-75M per cycle), replicated in two key pilot regions. |
| **Contingency** | $45-90M | A 20-30% contingency buffer, standard for high-risk ventures. |

### **Phase 2: Series A ($500M - $1B)**

| Category | Estimate | Bottom-Up Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scaled IEs** | $300-600M | Cost of running 5-10 simultaneous G7-nation-level campaigns. The prize model ($175M total for top 3) is a component of this. |
| **Incentive Alignment**| $50-100M | Seed capital for structured financial products designed to attract MIC partners. Sized to be competitive with their existing lobbying budgets. |
| **Platform Scale-Up**| $100-150M| Budget for scaling the platform to 300M+ users, including global CDN, security, and compliance features (e.g., GDPR). |
| **Legal Expansion** | $40-80M | Expands legal and lobbying footprint to an additional 10-15 countries. |

### **Phase 3: Growth ($500M - $1.1B)**

| Category | Estimate | Bottom-Up Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Saturation Campaigns**| $300-750M | All-out media and political pressure in the final 1-3 holdout nations, which will be the most expensive to win. |
| **MIC Co-Opting** | $50-100M | Final tranche of incentive capital for key corporate and political endorsements. |
| **Treasury Launch** | $100-150M| Includes costs for final, comprehensive security audits of the DIH treasury, insurance policies (e.g., against smart contract failure), and initial capitalization of DAO governance mechanisms. |

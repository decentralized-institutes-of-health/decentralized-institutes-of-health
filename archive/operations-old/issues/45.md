The monolithic `issues.yml` file is not ideal for human readability or rich content. Migrate the entire project management system to a directory structure at `operations/issues/`, where each issue is a separate markdown file with YAML frontmatter. This will improve usability in Wiki.js and allow for richer issue content.

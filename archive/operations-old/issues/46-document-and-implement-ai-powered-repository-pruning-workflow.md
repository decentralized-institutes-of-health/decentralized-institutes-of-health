## Summary

This task outlines the implementation of an AI-powered "Repository Custodian," a multi-agent system built with **`@Voltagent`**. This system will automate comprehensive repository maintenance tasks. The architecture is designed to be modular, observable, and cost-effective, leveraging a supervisor-worker pattern as recommended by the Voltagent framework.

## Proposed Multi-Agent Architecture

We will create a team of specialized agents, coordinated by a supervisor.

1.  **`MaintenanceSupervisor` (The Coordinator):**
    -   **Role:** Orchestrates the entire workflow. It initiates the analysis, delegates tasks to worker agents, compiles their findings into a "Maintenance Report," and, upon human approval, directs the `Executor` agent to apply the changes.

2.  **`StructureAnalyzer` (The Architect):**
    -   **Role:** A low-cost agent that analyzes the repository's file and directory structure.
    -   **Tasks:** Identifies violations of the information architecture (e.g., incorrect folder placement, deep nesting) and non-standard file names (`kebab-case`).

3.  **`LinkAndCitationAnalyzer` (The Librarian):**
    -   **Role:** A low-cost agent that ensures the integrity of links and citations.
    -   **Tasks:** Scans all documents to find broken internal links and uses heuristics to flag factual claims that are missing source citations.

4.  **`ContentRefactor` (The Editor):**
    -   **Role:** The primary content quality agent. It is only invoked by the `Supervisor` on a pre-filtered list of files to control costs.
    -   **Tasks:** Reviews content against the project's communication principles, suggests edits for clarity and tone, and validates that a file's content matches its location in the repository.

5.  **`FileSystemExecutor` (The Operator):**
    -   **Role:** A simple, security-focused agent that only performs write operations based on the approved report. It does not make independent decisions.
    -   **Tasks:** Executes file operations (`move`, `rename`, `edit`) as specified in the human-approved Maintenance Report.

## Phased Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis (Scheduled & Read-Only)

1.  A weekly GitHub Action triggers the `MaintenanceSupervisor`.
2.  The `Supervisor` dispatches the `StructureAnalyzer` and `LinkAndCitationAnalyzer` to perform initial, low-cost scans.
3.  Based on these findings, the `Supervisor` identifies a small subset of files requiring deeper review and delegates them to the `ContentRefactor` agent.
4.  All findings are compiled into a single, actionable "Maintenance Report" and posted as a new issue for review.

### Phase 2: Execution (Human-in-the-Loop)

1.  A project maintainer reviews, modifies, and approves the suggestions in the Maintenance Report.
2.  Once approved, the `MaintenanceSupervisor` is triggered again. It parses the approved report and instructs the `FileSystemExecutor` to apply the specified changes.

## Action Items

1.  **Setup `@Voltagent` Project:** Initialize a new Voltagent project within the repository (`npx create-voltagent-app@latest`).
2.  **Develop Worker Agents:** Implement the `StructureAnalyzer`, `LinkAndCitationAnalyzer`, and `ContentRefactor` agents and their associated tools.
3.  **Develop Executor Agent:** Implement the `FileSystemExecutor` with secure, well-defined file operation tools.
4.  **Develop Supervisor Agent:** Implement the `MaintenanceSupervisor` to orchestrate the full two-phase workflow.
5.  **Integrate with GitHub Actions:** Create the scheduled action for Phase 1 and the triggerable action for Phase 2.
6.  **Create Documentation:** Create the `operations/ai-workflows.md` document detailing the agent architecture, workflow, and how to interact with it.

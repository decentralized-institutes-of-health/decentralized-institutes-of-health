# Canonical Roadmap: From Plan to Global Impact

This document outlines the high-level, multi-year strategy to achieve the 1% Treaty. It presents a logical sequence of major phases, from initial planning to global impact. Each step is a massive undertaking with its own detailed implementation plan, which is linked accordingly.

See the [Operations Process Index](../operations/process-index.md) for links to the detailed, task-level plans for each project phase.

## Phase 0: Pre-Seed & Foundation (Months 0-3)

**Goal:** Establish the core legal and financial structure and hire the "activation team" required to execute the main capital raise and global campaign. This phase bridges the gap from concept to an investable, operational entity.

- **Key Activities:**
- **Legal:** Incorporate the two-entity structure: a for-profit management company (SPV) and a non-profit foundation. Secure initial legal opinions on securities and election law frameworks.
- **Fundraising:** Raise a **$1M-$3M pre-seed round** into the SPV to fund salaries, legal, and initial operations for 12-18 months.
- **Hiring:** Recruit the three core leads for the activation team (employees of the SPV):
- Capital Markets Lead
- Elections & IE Compliance Lead
- Growth & Referrals Lead
- **Strategy:** Finalize the data room, financial models, and pitch materials for the larger seed round.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Legal Framework (Months 1-12)

**Goal:** With a core team and seed funding in place, build the full legal, financial, and technical infrastructure required for the global campaign.

- **Key Activities:**
- **Team Expansion:** Recruit leads for Design, Engineering, and Policy.
- **Platform Development:** Build and deploy V1 of the global referendum platform, referral engine, and calculators.
- **Legal & Financial Infrastructure:** Select jurisdictions, formalize treasury management, finalize tokenomics, and begin drafting model legislation like the [Impact Securities Reform Act](../regulatory/impact-securities-reform.md).

## Phase 2: Capital & Political Mobilization (Months 12-36)

**Goal:** Raise the necessary capital and generate an undeniable global political mandate.

- [ ] **Launch the Primary Capital Raise:** Sell [VICTORY Bonds](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md) under the new impact securities framework, targeting a \$1.2-2.5B raise to fund the global campaign.
- [ ] **Execute the Global Referendum:** Launch the campaign to secure 3.5% global participation (280M+ votes) for the 1% Treaty, creating the political mandate ([Global Referendum Implementation](./referendum/global-referendum-implementation.md)).
- [ ] **Secure Treaty Adoption:** Leverage the referendum mandate and a well-funded independent expenditure engine to achieve legal adoption of the 1% Treaty in key nations.

---

## Phase 3: Execution & Impact (Years 3-5+)

**Goal:** Receive the treaty funds, deliver on promises to investors, and execute the mission.

- [ ] **Activate the DIH Treasury:** Begin receiving the 1% revenue stream (\$27B+ annually) from signatory nations.
- [ ] **Deliver Superior Returns to Investors:** Repay `VICTORY Bond` holders with a return engineered to be superior to alternative investments, fulfilling the core financial promise.
- [ ] **Fund Global Public Goods:** Deploy treasury funds to high-impact initiatives, with the primary focus on subsidizing patient participation in efficient, decentralized clinical trials via the **[dFDA Platform Technical Roadmap](../features/dfda-roadmap.md)**.

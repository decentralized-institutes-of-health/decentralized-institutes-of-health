# How Nonprofits Can Support the 1% Treaty Without Lobbying

Nonprofits can play a powerful role in advancing the 1% Treaty while staying within legal boundaries that avoid lobbying reporting or expenditure tracking. According to the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/lobbying) and nonprofit best practices, the following activities are **not considered lobbying** and are generally safe for 501(c)(3) organizations and similar entities:

## Permitted Activities (Not Lobbying)

- **Educational Meetings & Events**
  - Host forums, webinars, or workshops to inform the public about the 1% Treaty, its goals, and the facts about military vs. health spending.
- **Distribute Educational Materials**
  - Share fact sheets, infographics, articles, or videos explaining the treaty and its potential impact, without urging action on specific legislation.
- **Publish Research & Analysis**
  - Release reports, white papers, or blog posts that analyze the cost-benefit of redirecting military spending to health research.
- **General Public Awareness Campaigns**
  - Use social media, newsletters, and press releases to raise awareness about the treaty and the issues it addresses, as long as you do not call for legislative action.
- **Ambassadorship**
  - Encourage staff, volunteers, and board members to talk about the organization's mission and the treaty in the community, focusing on education and awareness.
- **Nonpartisan Voter Education**
  - Provide information about where candidates or officials stand on issues related to the treaty, without endorsing or opposing any candidate or legislation.
- **Community Engagement**
  - Facilitate discussions or listening sessions to gather community input on the treaty and related health policy issues.
- **Respond to Requests for Information**
  - Answer questions from the public, media, or policymakers about the treaty in a factual, non-advocacy manner.

## What to Avoid (Lobbying Triggers)

- Urging the public or legislators to support, oppose, or take action on specific legislation or ballot measures.
- Asking people to contact their representatives about a specific bill or treaty.
- Drafting or helping draft legislation.

## Key Sources

> **Tip:** Focus on education, research, and public awareness—not direct calls to legislative action—to maximize your impact without triggering lobbying rules.

## Specific Ways Nonprofits Can Support the 1% Treaty & DIH (Without Lobbying)

- **Host Educational Events on Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)**
  - Organize webinars or panels explaining how DIH works, its global cooperation model, and the benefits of redirecting military spending to health research ([see DIH details](decentralized-institutes-of-health.md)).
- **Publish Case Studies and Infographics**
  - Create and share visual explainers on the impact of the 1% Treaty, the scale of military vs. health spending, and the potential of decentralized science ([see 1% Treaty](1-percent-treaty.md)).
- **Share DAO Creation Insights**
  - Educate your audience about what a DAO is, how it can fund global health research, and the cost breakdown for launching such an initiative ([see DAO cost breakdown](cost-to-create-a-dao.md)).
- **Promote Open Calls for Research Proposals**
  - Publicize opportunities for researchers to submit projects to the DIH platform, emphasizing transparency and global participation.
- **Facilitate Community Discussions**
  - Hold listening sessions or roundtables to gather input on priorities for DIH funding and share these insights publicly (not as policy recommendations).
- **Support Referral-Rewards Campaigns (Education Only)**
  - Explain how referral-rewards systems can help mobilize public support for health research and policy change, using historical examples and cost-effectiveness data ([see referral-rewards system](../referral-rewards-system.md)).
  - Share best practices for ethical, transparent digital advocacy without urging action on specific legislation.
- **Highlight Success Stories**
  - Feature stories of decentralized research breakthroughs, successful DAOs, or viral public health campaigns to inspire and inform.
- **Develop Toolkits for Grassroots Engagement**
  - Provide templates, guides, or FAQs for individuals and organizations to educate their networks about the 1% Treaty and DIH.
- **Connect Stakeholders**
  - Facilitate introductions between researchers, technologists, and patient groups interested in decentralized health innovation.

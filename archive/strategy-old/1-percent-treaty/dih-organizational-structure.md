# DIH Organizational Structure

The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is designed to mirror the structure of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), providing a familiar and comprehensive framework for researchers, patients, and partner organizations.

Each of the following Institutes and Centers will operate as a subordinate DAO (subDAO) under the main DIH Treasury. Governance of each subDAO will be delegated to the coalition of non-profit partners, research institutions, and patient advocacy groups that were instrumental in the ratification of the 1% Treaty.

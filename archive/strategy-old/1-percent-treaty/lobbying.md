# The Military Lobbying Ecosystem

Lobbying in the military sector is a highly specialized and lucrative field where significant financial investments are made to influence policy, secure large-scale government contracts, and shape national military priorities. This ecosystem involves a complex interplay between military contractors, politicians, and government agencies, all revolving around a multi-trillion-dollar global market.

Military contractors globally are estimated to spend between $200 million and $300 million annually on lobbying efforts. These investments are directed towards influencing military policy, securing contracts, and shaping military spending priorities.

#### Government Contracts to Military Contractors

The primary goal of lobbying is to secure a larger share of the massive government spending allocated to military procurement. Globally, this amounts to between **$800 billion and $1 trillion annually**.

### Case Studies

- **Lockheed Martin**: This company consistently ranks as one of the top lobbying spenders, with annual expenditures often exceeding **$15 million**. In return, they secure tens of billions in government contracts each year, showcasing a return on investment that can be several thousand percent.
- **Boeing and Northrop Grumman**: Similarly, these firms invest heavily in lobbying (often in the **$10-15 million** range annually) and see massive returns in the form of contracts for aircraft, missiles, and other military hardware.

### Return on Investment (ROI)

The ROI on lobbying in the military sector is notoriously high. For every dollar spent on lobbying, companies can expect to see returns in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars in secured contracts.

- **Calculation**: A company spending **$15 million** on lobbying and securing **$50 billion** in contracts (a common scenario for a top contractor) would see an ROI of approximately **333,233%**.

## The Cost of a Lobbyist

The cost of hiring a top-tier lobbyist with a proven track record of influencing military policy can range from **$500,000 to over $2 million annually**. These costs include not only the lobbyist's salary but also the expenses associated with building relationships, making campaign contributions, and running sophisticated influence campaigns.

### Top Lobbying Firms

Firms like **Covington & Burling**, **Akin Gump**, and **Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck** are known for their powerful military lobbying practices and command premium fees for their services.

## Conclusion

The military lobbying industry is a prime example of how targeted financial investments can yield disproportionately large returns. For a relatively small investment of a few hundred million dollars annually, the entire industry secures close to a trillion dollars in government contracts. This dynamic provides a clear model for how a well-funded and strategically executed lobbying campaign by a DAO could effectively influence policy and achieve its objectives.

## Co-Opting vs. Building Our Own Lobbying

Instead of competing directly with this machine, our strategy is to co-opt it by aligning contractors' interests with ours via superior investment returns (e.g., VICTORY bonds). This turns opposition into advocacy. For a detailed analysis of why this is superior to adversarial tactics, see [Co-Opting Defense Contractors](../co-opting-defense-contractors.md).

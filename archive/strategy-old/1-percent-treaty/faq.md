# FAQ

## Q: Why focus on reducing military spending? Shouldn't we just increase health research funding directly?

While increasing health research funding through any means is valuable, tying it to a small reduction in military spending serves several purposes. First, it provides a clear funding source that doesn't take away from other priorities (see [why reallocation is necessary](why-reallocation-is-necessary.md)). Second, it sparks a conversation about the opportunity costs of our current resource allocation and whether it aligns with our values (see [cost of war](cost-of-war.md) and [cost of disease](cost-of-disease.md)). Third, it creates a mechanism for global cooperation and trust-building as nations take this step together. Finally, even a small shift from militarism to health sends a powerful signal about the world we want to build.

## Q: Is a 1% reduction in military budgets really enough to make a difference?

While 1% may seem small, it translates to around $20 billion per year globally - a transformative sum for health research (see [1% Treaty](1-percent-treaty.md)).

It's also important to remember that this is intended as a starting point, not an end goal. As countries experience the benefits of this reallocation, they may be inspired to go further.

Even a 1% shift sets a crucial precedent and begins to normalize the idea of prioritizing health over warfare.

## Q: How can we ensure that countries actually follow through on their commitments?

The [1% Treaty](1-percent-treaty.md) should include robust auditing and verification mechanisms to hold countries accountable. This could involve regular reporting, independent inspections, and penalties for non-compliance. Blockchain technology could also create transparent, tamper-proof records of contributions. Ultimately, the treaty's power will come from the collective weight of global norms and diplomatic pressure as much as formal enforcement.

## Q: Won't reducing military strength make countries more vulnerable?

So there are two ways to increase national security:

1. Have an endless arms race where everyone keeps spending more and more on weapons.
2. All countries will be reducing their military budgets proportionally, so the balance of power remains unchanged.
   No country gains a military advantage.

In fact,
the national security of everyone would be _**increased**_ because all their enemies would have 1% less bombs,
biological weapons, etc. to destroy them with.

## Q: How can we ensure the funds are used effectively?

The proposal's [innovative funding model](decentralized-institutes-of-health.md) is designed to maximize impact. Subsidies for patient participation are algorithmically allocated to trials with the highest expected value to society, ensuring resources flow to the most promising research. For other functions, like infrastructure development, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) provides transparent, community-aligned governance.

## Q: Is it really possible to get a global treaty ratified in today's polarized geopolitical climate?

It's a significant challenge, but not impossible. The key is that the treaty is designed to be **geopolitically neutral**. Since every nation reduces its military spending by the same percentage, the relative balance of power remains unchanged. No nation loses its strategic advantage.

## Q: Don't we already spend a lot on medical research?

Even if your country is a leader in health research, a global effort will yield benefits that no nation can achieve alone.

Diseases don't respect borders, and breakthroughs in one part of the world can save lives everywhere.

By pooling resources and expertise on a global scale, we accelerate progress and ensure fair access to treatments.

We also reduce the risk of devastating cross-border biological threats, enhancing everyone's security. Supporting this treaty is a recognition that, in our interconnected age, health is a global public good that requires collective action.

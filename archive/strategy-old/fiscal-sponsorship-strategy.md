# Fiscal Sponsorship Strategy

This document outlines the strategic approach for engaging with non-profit organizations to secure funding, build credibility, and accelerate the mission of the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH). Our primary mechanism for early-stage fundraising is **fiscal sponsorship**.

## The Core Challenge

The DIH is a large-scale, unconventional project. Before we establish our own independent legal entities (e.g., a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4)), we need a legally compliant and trusted channel to accept donations. A direct appeal for a project involving "legal bribery" and complex tokenomics could be confusing and inhibit contributions from traditional philanthropic sources.

## The Solution: A Phased Fiscal Sponsorship Strategy

Our strategy is to partner with existing, respected non-profits who can act as fiscal sponsors. This approach provides immediate credibility and allows donors to make tax-deductible contributions.

We will pursue this in two distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Secure One Primary Fiscal Host for the General Fund

Our immediate priority is to establish a single, primary fiscal sponsor to act as the home for the **DIH General Fund**.

#### Why a Single Host First?

1.  **Clarity for Donors:** A single, clear "Donate Here" button directed to one trusted entity minimizes confusion and builds confidence. Offering multiple options at the start can cause analysis paralysis and reduce donation conversion.
2.  **Brand Cohesion:** It presents the project as focused and organized, channeling all initial support through one primary partner.
3.  **Administrative Simplicity:** Managing one contractual relationship, one fee structure, and one reporting channel is efficient and allows our team to focus on the mission, not on administrative overhead.

#### Ideal Profile for Primary Host

*   **Broad Mission:** An organization focused on general "health innovation," "medical research policy," "patient empowerment," or "efficient government."
*   **Innovative Mindset:** A non-profit with a history of supporting novel, high-impact, or technology-driven projects.

#### Standard Partnership Terms

A key component of our fiscal sponsorship model is ensuring that our partners benefit directly from their fundraising efforts. The standard agreement will include the following terms:

*   **10% for Unrestricted Use:** The partner organization will retain 10% of all funds raised through their channels for their own unrestricted operational use. This provides a direct financial incentive and supports their core mission.
*   **90% for the DIH Mission:** The remaining 90% of funds will be allocated to the specific, mutually-agreed-upon DIH program or the General Fund, ensuring that the vast majority of donations go directly to funding the shared mission.

This model creates a powerful win-win scenario, allowing partners to fund their own operations while making a major contribution to a larger, systemic solution.

### Phase 2: Expand with Multiple, Specialized Hosts for Targeted Fundraising

Once the General Fund is established and core operations are stable, we will expand our partnerships to include multiple, specialized non-profits. This allows for hyper-targeted fundraising campaigns.

#### Why Multiple Hosts Later?

1.  **Targeted Fundraising:** A donor passionate about Alzheimer's is far more likely to contribute to the **Decentralized Institute on Aging** when it is fiscally sponsored by a leading Alzheimer's research foundation.
2.  **Access to Niche Donor Networks:** Each specialized non-profit partner provides access to its unique community of passionate supporters, volunteers, and mailing listsâ€”a powerful channel for reaching pre-qualified audiences.
3.  **Enhanced Legitimacy:** Partnering with a major cancer foundation for a "Decentralized Institute of Cancer Research" fund lends instant, domain-specific credibility that a general sponsor cannot.

## Action Plan & Pitching Strategy

1.  **Identify & Vet:** Research and identify a shortlist of potential primary fiscal sponsors that fit the "broad mission" profile.
2.  **Develop a Simplified Pitch:** Create a concise, 1-2 page proposal that focuses on the least controversial and most compelling aspects of the DIH for an initial approach.
    *   **The Hook:** Frame the project around patient-centricity, research efficiency (the 80x cheaper trial model), and empowering patients.
    *   **De-emphasize:** Initially, downplay the more radical political and economic elements. The goal is to get a foot in the door by highlighting the shared mission of accelerating cures.
3.  **Launch Phase 1:** Secure the primary sponsor and launch the General Fund donation drive.
4.  **Initiate Phase 2:** Once Phase 1 is successful, begin outreach to specialized non-profits. Pitch them on sponsoring specific, named "programs" or "funds" that align directly with their core mission (e.g., "The Patient-Powered Rare Disease Trial Fund, a project of the DIH").
5.  **Website Integration:** As specialized funds are established, update the main project website to feature a clear, two-part donation page:
    *   A primary call-to-action for the **General Fund**.
    *   A secondary section for **Specialized Funds**, allowing donors to support work on specific diseases through our trusted partners.

## Objective

Enable compliant participation from unaccredited/retail investors while Phase 1 (Reg D/Reg S) proceeds.

## Routes

### Regulation A+ (Tier 2)

- **Capacity:** Up to $75M per 12 months
- **Timeline:** 4–9 months prep + SEC qualification
- **Materials:** 2Y audited financials, Offering Circular (Form 1‑A), risk factors, marketing plan, transfer agent
- **KYC/AML:** Required; broker/ATS optional but recommended
- **Notes:** Good for broad U.S. access and legitimacy; align launch with milestones

### Regulation CF

- **Capacity:** ≈$5M per 12 months via FINRA‑registered portal
- **Timeline:** 1–3 months
- **Materials:** Form C, reviewed financials, portal listings, investor education
- **KYC/AML:** Portal‑managed
- **Notes:** Community alignment; smaller checks; can run before Reg A+ is qualified

### International (examples)

- **EU (ECSPR):** Up to €5M via authorized crowdfunding service provider; passporting across EU
- **UK:** FCA‑authorized platforms; appropriateness tests; retail caps
- **SG/HK:** Explore VCC/authorized portals for region‑specific retail routes

## Parallelization

- Run Reg D + Reg S now; spin up Reg CF campaign to prime retail; prepare Reg A+ package in parallel
- Sequence: CF (early) → Reg A+ (post‑milestones) for U.S. retail; add EU/UK portals as legal confirms

## Guardrails

- No token/auction listings targeting U.S. retail prior to Reg A+
- Clear separation of donation vs investment channels
- Centralized compliance tracker; counsel checkpoints per jurisdiction

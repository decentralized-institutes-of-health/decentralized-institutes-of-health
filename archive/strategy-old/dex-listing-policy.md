## Phased Liquidity Strategy

- **Phase 1 — Walled Garden:** No public trading. Tokens non‑transferable or restricted to permissioned registry during Reg D/Reg S phase.
- **Phase 2 — Qualified Retail:** Reg A+ live; limited transferability with lockups; secondary venue selection with broker/ATS where applicable.
- **Phase 3 — DEX Consideration:** Only after treasury utility is live (governance executing over active, funded programs) and counsel confirms utility posture.

## Preconditions for Any DEX Listing

1. Legal sign‑off (U.S. and primary non‑U.S. counsel) that listing will not constitute unlawful offer/sale
2. Utility maturity: on‑chain governance controlling active, funded treasury programs; public docs
3. Transfer controls/guardrails: vesting/lockups, wallet whitelisting if required, disclosures
4. Market integrity: anti‑sybil and monitoring in place; clear disclosure of risks and non‑entitlement
5. Communications plan: no profit promises; consistent with Offering Circular/PPM

## Approval Workflow

- Prepare memo: legal analysis, jurisdictional map, risks/mitigations
- Internal committee review (Legal, Compliance, Treasury, Security)
- Board/DAO proposal and vote
- Publish public note with FAQs and disclosures

## Monitoring & Incident Response

- On‑chain surveillance: wash trading, manipulation, sanctions exposure
- Circuit breakers: pause hooks for non‑governance functions if severe incidents
- Disclosure protocol: rapid public updates; regulator liaison via counsel

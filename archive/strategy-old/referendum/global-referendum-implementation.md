## Objective

Implement a privacy-preserving, globally verifiable referendum to assess public support for the [1% Treaty](../1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty.md) and DIH. Outputs must be auditable and persuasive to policymakers.

## Principles

- **Verifiability**: End-to-end cryptographic proofs of inclusion and tally correctness.
- **Privacy**: Ballot secrecy; minimal personal data collection.
- **Equity**: Strong Sybil resistance without excluding the unbanked or undocumented.
- **Transparency**: Open-source code, public audits, post-election publish of artifacts.

## System Architecture

- **Voting protocol**: Use an end-to-end verifiable scheme (Helios or similar) with individual ballot verification and public bulletin board.
  - Reference: Helios (Adida et al.)
- **Identity / Sybil resistance**: Multi-factor: email/phone OTP; device/browser fingerprinting; optional liveness/biometrics; integration with national e-ID where available (e.g., models informed by Estonia’s experience); proof-of-uniqueness partners.
- **Fraud controls**: Risk scoring, velocity limits, manual review queues; bounty program for reporting abuse.
- **Internationalization**: 40+ locale support; accessibility-first UI.

## Integrity and Auditing

- **Crypto receipts**: Each voter receives a tracking code to verify inclusion.
- **Public audit**: Publish anonymized ballots, ZK proofs or mixnet transcripts, parameters, and code commit hashes.
- **Observer program**: NGO and academic observers with read-only monitors.

## Incentives and Referrals

- **Rewards**: Funded via VICTORY bonds with strict anti-fraud and per-cap caps; public ledger of reward disbursements.
- **Education-first**: Reward structured learning paths before voting to reduce low-information participation.

## Legal Positioning

- **Consultation framing**: Non-binding global consultation to demonstrate consent; country-specific bridges to official mechanisms where feasible.
- **Data protection**: GDPR/CCPA alignment; minimal retention; DPIAs published.

## Success Metrics

- Verification rate, audit pass rate, unique-voter deduplication quality, and policymaker adoption of results.

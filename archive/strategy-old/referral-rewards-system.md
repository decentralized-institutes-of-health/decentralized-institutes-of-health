# War on Disease: Tiered Incentive & Referral System

This document specifies the design for a tiered, multi-level referral and incentive system to drive participation in the 1% Treaty global referendum. The goal is to create a powerful, self-propagating engine for growth that is resistant to fraud and aligns incentives across individuals, organizations, and coalitions. While this system focuses on incentivizing *participation*, our strategy for incentivizing *skilled contributions* is detailed in the [Open Ecosystem and Bounty Model](./open-ecosystem-and-bounty-model.md).

## Tier 1: Mass Participation (VOTE Points)

The goal of this tier is to achieve maximum global scale (3.5% of humanity) with minimal friction and legal risk.

-   **Mechanism:** For every verified vote on the global referendum, the participant and the referrer receive a grant of non-transferable **VOTE points.**
-   **The Incentive:** VOTE points serve as your verifiable claim to real economic value you help create. Their value is backed by your contribution to unlocking the [$16.5 trillion annual peace dividend](../economic-models/peace-dividend-value-capture.md) through military budget redirection. After the 1% Treaty is ratified, they become **convertible to VICTORY governance tokens** representing your earned ownership stake in the captured value. This transforms a simple vote into ownership of the wealth you generate for humanity.
-   **Why it Works:** This "Points-then-Conversion" model allows us to sidestep the immense legal and operational complexity of a direct airdrop of a security token to 280 million people, while still providing a powerful, motivating incentive for mass participation.

## Tier 2: Power Users & Organizers (VICTORY Token Grants)

The goal of this tier is to attract and reward the high-value contributors who will build the movement.

-   **Mechanism:** Large, direct grants of **VICTORY bonds/bonds** will be awarded to key contributors through targeted prize campaigns, grant programs, and performance-based partnerships. These represent earned ownership stakes in the real economic value created by successful military-to-health budget redirection.
-   **Target Audience:**
  -   **Organizers:** Community leaders who drive millions of referendum votes.
  -   **Developers:** Individuals and teams who build valuable tools on top of our platform.
  -   **Strategic Partners:** Institutions, lobbying firms, and campaign teams whose work directly leads to treaty ratification.
-   **Why it Works:** For this smaller, more sophisticated group of contributors, we can afford to run a legally compliant distribution process for VICTORY instruments. This gives our most valuable partners a direct, immediate, and powerful stake in the outcome, transforming them from contractors into owners.

## Why 3.5%? The Tipping Point for Systemic Change

Research shows that when just **3.5% of a population** actively participates in a movement, systemic change becomes highly likely ([source](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)). For the FDA Upgrade and Right to Trial Initiative, this means mobilizing **3.5% of the population in key countries around the world**, starting with an initial target of **12 million Americans**. Reaching this tipping point in major nations is the key to creating the political will for global policy transformation.

> The "3.5% rule" is based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, who analyzed hundreds of nonviolent movements and found that those engaging at least 3.5% of the population have never failed to achieve serious political change. This threshold is now widely cited as the tipping point for successful social movements ([BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world), [Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s7wm)).

## The 80X Efficiency Benchmark: Oxford RECOVERY Trial

The [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) demonstrated that decentralized, pragmatic trials can reduce per-patient costs from **$41,000** to **$500**—an **80X efficiency gain** ([Manhattan Institute](https://manhattan.institute/article/slow-costly-clinical-trials-drag-down-biomedical-breakthroughs), [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295430/)). This model saved over **1 million lives** globally by rapidly identifying effective COVID-19 treatments ([UKRI Impact Report](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/how-we-are-doing/research-outcomes-and-impact/mrc/recovery-trial-identifies-covid-19-treatments/)).

> **Goal:** Replicate this 80X efficiency for all medical research by passing aligned legislation in multiple countries, using viral referral rewards to reach the 3.5% tipping point in each nation.

## Evidence of Latent Public Support (U.S. Case Study)

*While polling shows similar sentiment exists worldwide, the following data from the United States serves as a strong case study for the latent public support waiting to be mobilized.*

| Data point                                                                        | Source                                                   |

| >80 % approval when longevity is framed as "health improvement"                   | ([Health-span framing study 2024](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/articlepdf/2827753/garmany_2024_oi_241395_1733259944.03263.pdf)) |

> **Take-away:** The core challenge is not a lack of public support, but the absence of a legal and logistical path to channel that sentiment into effective action.

## How Referral Rewards Drive Viral Participation

A well-designed referral-rewards system can:

- **Drop verified-vote costs below $1** (and as low as $0.20–$0.30 in viral scenarios)
- Mobilize millions through organic, peer-driven sharing
- Incentivize both direct action and network growth

### Cost Breakdown (per verified vote)

| Component         | Conservative | Aggressive (Viral) | Notes                                 |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Direct Rewards   | $0.50–$0.75  | $0.30–$0.50        | Cash, merch, or crypto                |
| Paid Reach       | $0.75–$1.00  | $0.10              | Ads, influencer micro-fees            |
| Verification     | $0.25        | $0.05              | KYC-lite vs. email/phone only         |
| **Total**        | **$1.50–$2** | **$0.45–$0.65**    | Can drop to $0.20–$0.30 in best case  |

**Benchmarks:**

- **EveryLibrary – "Fight for the First" 2023–24:** Email-verified petition/pledge to local officials. Reported cost ≈ **$0.56 per verified action** (derived from $250–$1,000 ad spend per local drive producing 90,000 actions across ~100 drives). ([Source: EveryLibrary About](https://www.everylibrary.org/about-everylibrary))
- **EveryLibrary Facebook/email drives (internal recap):** Library-funding calls & petitions reported at "A few **pennies per action**". ([Source: EveryLibrary cost-per-action ("few pennies")](https://pcsweeney.com/tag/library-activism/))
- **Change.org Promoted Petitions:** Uses a Cost Per Mille (CPM) or cost-per-impression model.
  - "$100 invested by promotions, a petition will be featured to 2,000 people" (equates to $0.05 per impression or $50 CPM). ([Source: Change.org Help](https://help.change.org/supporting-petition/what-does-it-mean-to-promote-a-petition))
  - "$8 will result in the petition ads being displayed to 100 people" (equates to $0.08 per impression or $80 CPM). ([Source: Change.org FAQ](https://www.change.org/l/us/chipping-in-explained))
  - Based on typical signature-conversion rates quoted in user analyses, the **effective cost is estimated at $0.20–$0.40 per added signature**. ([Sources: The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/15/avaaz-online-campaigning-reinvent-politics), [Change.org Promoted Petitions Instructions](https://www.change.org/l/hi/promoted-petitions-instructions), [Change.org promoted petition math](https://help.change.org/supporting-petition/what-does-it-mean-to-promote-a-petition))
  *Note: The effective cost per action (e.g., signature) is variable and depends on the petition's conversion rate from impression to signature.*
- **Avaaz global pledge initiatives:** Email-verified signatures reported at **≈ $0.32 per action** (Avaaz finance FAQ). ([Source: Avaaz finance page (≈ \$0.32 CPA)](<https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/avaaz_expenses_and_financial_information/>))
- [GiveDirectly 2021](https://www.givedirectly.org/): $0.48 per verified crypto match
- **Cost to Obtain Survey Responses (Platform Cost):** Survey platforms like Pollfish indicate costs to businesses starting at ~$0.95 per survey completion, which is the platform's charge for acquiring a response, not a direct referral payout. ([Pollfish](https://www.pollfish.com/pricing/survey-calculator/))
- **Voter Turnout Referrals (Get-Out-the-Vote Initiative Specific):** Some get-out-the-vote initiatives have offered referrers around $10 per successful referral for getting someone to vote in an official election. ([TurnoutTeam.com](https://turnoutteam.com/))
- **U.S. Ballot Initiative Field Collection (2024 Average):** *Wet-ink* legal signatures (a much higher bar). Reported cost: **$14.87 per signature**. ([Source: Ballotpedia 2024](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_measure_signature_costs%2C_2024))
- **General Referral Incentive Sizing:** Referral rewards are often determined based on the expected value or Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of the referred individual. A common approach is to offer a fraction of this value back to the referrer and/or the new user. ([Andrew Chen - How to Design a Referral Program](https://andrewchen.com/how-to-design-a-referral-program/))

> **Take-away:** Digital advocacy groups are already acquiring verified actions for **well under $0.60**. A performance cap of **≤ $0.50 per verified pledge** (and bonuses for < $0.30) is defensible. Using digital tactics and referral loops, **< $0.50 per verified pledge** is achievable.

## Practical Steps to Achieve Viral Scale

1. **Performance Awards + Leaderboards**
   - Weekly leaderboard awards for top contributors (denominated in VOTE points)
   - Randomized recognition awards for verified referrers (in VOTE points)
   - Keeps marginal cost per new vote near zero after pool is funded
2. **Lower-Touch Verification (Early Phases)**
   - Email + phone OTP for initial onboarding
   - Add selfie-ID only when legally required by a jurisdiction
   - Saves $0.15–$0.20 per participant
3. **Partner Newsletters > Paid Ads**
   - Ready-to-send HTML for disease foundations, patient forums, Reddit, etc.
   - A single 100k-subscriber list at 5% conversion = 5,000 votes for almost no incremental cash
4. **Creative Viral Marketing**: See [Viral Marketing Tactics](./viral-marketing-tactics.md) for detailed implementation of:
   - QR code t-shirts and wearable marketing
   - Social media challenges and meme campaigns
   - Community building and local activation
   - Event marketing and content strategies
5. **Track K-Factor (Viral Coefficient) Weekly**
   - K > 0.8: Cut ad spend
   - K < 0.5: Increase award pool or test new creatives

## Cost Scenarios for 200,000 Verified Votes

| Scenario             | Reward Pool | Paid Ads | Ops    | Total   | $/vote |
|----------------------|------------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Baseline (roadmap)   | $25k       | $150k    | $25k   | $200k   | $1.00  |
| Partner-list heavy   | $25k       | $40k     | $20k   | $85k    | $0.43  |
| Viral best-case      | $25k       | $15k     | $10k   | $50k    | $0.25  |

## VICTORY Tokens: Funding the Referral Rewards System

### Why VICTORY Tokens?

- Inspired by WWII war bonds, VICTORY bonds represent earned ownership of real economic value created by capturing the [peace dividend](../economic-models/peace-dividend-value-capture.md).
- Purpose: Directly finance this viral referral-rewards system to mobilize 3.5% of the population, creating the political mandate needed to redirect $27B annually from military destruction to health creation.
- Value Backing: Each token represents a fractional ownership claim on the [$16.5 trillion annual peace dividend](../economic-models/peace-dividend-value-capture.md) unlocked by systematic military budget redirection—real economic value, not speculative assets.
- Goal: Unlock the same scale of transformation as the Oxford RECOVERY trial, which achieved an [80X efficiency gain](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) in clinical research.

### How It Works

- **Purchase VICTORY bonds** to fund verified votes and actions in support of the Act. Incentive Mechanics and compliance considerations are detailed in [VICTORY Bonds — Incentive Mechanics](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md).
- **Each token** directly funds a specific number of verified votes (target: <$1 per vote, with potential for $0.20–$0.30 in viral scenarios—see the "Benchmarks" section above).
- **All transactions** are transparently tracked on-chain, with a public dashboard showing progress toward the 3.5% tipping point ([BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)).

### Incentives for Supporters

- **Share in future healthcare savings** or referral award pools, aligning incentives with the initiative's success.
- **Governance rights**: Token holders may help steer the initiative's direction and reward distribution.
- **Recognition**: Top contributors featured on leaderboards and in updates.

### Transparency & Accountability

- **Open, auditable records** of all token sales and reward distributions.
- **Real-time impact dashboard**: See how many votes/actions your support has funded.
- **Economic model**: "Every $1,000 in VICTORY bonds funds 1,000+ verified votes, unlocking $X in healthcare savings and Y lives improved."

## Concrete Path to Mobilization (Global Template)

| Phase                            | Deliverable                           | Target                                   | Budget guide                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **0. Infra (3 mo)**              | Pledge stack + referral engine        | Live; fraud-checked                      | ≈ \$60 k (engineer, ads, tests) |
| **1. Pilot Region/District (1-2 mo)**   | 10-20 k pledges in one swing region | ≤ \$0.50 CPA                             | ≤ \$10 k                        |
| **2. Country-wide Scale (6-9 mo)** | 1 M pledges in first target country      | \$0.30-\$0.40 CPA                          | \$300-\$400 k                   |
| **3. Policy Channel**            | Bill text + briefings for legislators  | —                                        | parallel                        |
| **4. Must-pass Vehicle**         | Attach to major health legislation (e.g., U.S. FDA User-Fee Act) | —                                        | coalition                       |

## Addressing Political Friction (U.S. Case Study)

*The risks and mitigation strategies below are specific to the United States effort and serve as a template for analysis in other target countries.*

| Risk                                  | Mitigation                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safety advocates claim "deregulation" | Emphasize RECOVERY-style pragmatic trials & safety analytics.               |
| FDA inertia                           | Frame as **Phase IV modernization** rather than gutting the agency.                |
| Pharma incumbents                     | Seek endorsements from small-biotech and generics eager for cheaper trials. |

## Bottom-Line Feasibility Analysis (Initial U.S. Initiative)

| Factor                    | Feasible?                          | Evidence                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Latent public support     | ✅                                  | see section 1 (polls & RTT precedent) |
| Cost to reach 1 M pledges | ✅ (\$0.5 × 1 M = \$500 k)          | section 3 benchmarks                  |
| Legislative path          | ✅ (e.g., 2027 UFA or RTT-2.0)            | historical use of must-pass riders    |
| Execution risk            | ⚠️ needs milestones & single owner | see digital CPA cases                 |

**Conclusion:** With disciplined list-building (≤ \$0.50 CPA) and a suitable "must-pass" legislative vehicle in each target country, this public education effort is realistically winnable on a global scale. The immediate next step is building the pledge engine and proving the model in a pilot region.

---

## Why This Matters: Quantitative Impact

- **Replicating RECOVERY's 80X efficiency** would allow nations to run 80 times more trials for the same budget ([reference](reference/recovery-trial.md)).
- Mobilizing 3.5% of the population with referral rewards can create the political will to pass enabling legislation worldwide, unlocking these savings for all diseases.
- **Potential: Save millions of lives, cut drug development costs by 95%, and accelerate cures for rare and common diseases alike.**

## Real-World Impact: How Public Support Drives Policy Change

Below are three well-documented cases where **large-scale, measurable public support translated into concrete policy change.** They illustrate different mechanisms—petitions, massive online comments, and sustained mobilization—so you can show Keith (or anyone) that *numbers really do move lawmakers* when the threshold is high enough.

| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **U.S. Net Neutrality (2014-15)**               | *≈ 4 million public comments* to the FCC + 100 000-signature White-House petition                                 | FCC and White House both had to issue formal responses; President Obama publicly urged Title II reclassification | FCC adopted **strong Title II net-neutrality rules** in Feb 2015                                                               | ([time.com][1], [washingtonpost.com][2])              |
| **UK Parliament e-petitions**                   | Any petition that hits **100 000 signatures** is "almost always" scheduled for a floor debate                     | Reaching the threshold forces the Petitions Committee to respond and usually sets a debate date                  | Examples include debates on meningitis vaccines, Brexit preparations, and highway code changes that later informed legislation | ([petition.parliament.uk][3], [parliament.uk][4])     |

### Take-aways you can cite

1. **Digital advocacy ≠ empty clicks.**
   Net-neutrality's *4 million comments* and *100 k petition* directly preceded the FCC's strongest pro-consumer rule-making in decades.

2. **Formal thresholds matter.**
   In the UK system, **100 000 signers reliably buys parliamentary airtime**—a practical, repeatable path from signature to legislative debate.

3. **The 3.5 % rule is real.**
   Harvard's Erica Chenoweth shows that *active* engagement at that scale (e.g., ≈ 12 M Americans) has been historically sufficient for transformative change every single time it's been reached.

So when you propose a pledge/ referral system that can gather tens of thousands—or eventually millions—of *district-mapped yes/no pledges*, you're standing on solid historical precedent: **big verified numbers force decision-makers to act.**

**With a disciplined referral-reward loop—and the right partner lists—we can comfortably beat $1 per verified vote and may reach sub-$0.30 territory. This is the lever to unlock 80X faster medical progress for everyone.**

## Economic Model & Incentive Mechanics Integration

-   **VOTE Points:** These represent your verifiable claim to a share of the economic value you help create by building the political mandate for military budget redirection. They are non-transferable pre-treaty and minted to reflect your contribution to unlocking the [$16.5 trillion peace dividend](../economic-models/peace-dividend-value-capture.md).
-   **VICTORY Conversion:** Upon treaty ratification, your earned VOTE points convert to VICTORY governance tokens representing actual ownership of the $27B annual treasury created by your advocacy work. The conversion rate will be fixed and transparent from day one, reflecting the real value you helped create.
-   **Tier 2 Grants:** VICTORY bonds for high-impact contributors represent earned ownership stakes in the captured peace dividend value, allocated from the "Ecosystem & Community Growth" fund based on measurable contributions to treaty success.

This system ensures participants earn real ownership of the economic value they create, not speculative digital assets with no intrinsic backing.

## Benchmarks & Cost Analysis (DEPRECATED)

**NOTE:** The following cost-per-acquisition (CPA) analysis is based on the previous fiat-based model. It is retained for historical context but is no longer the primary model. The new model dramatically reduces upfront cash costs, shifting the expense to a contingent token liability.

-   **Goal:** Drop verified-vote costs below $1 (and as low as $0.20–$0.30 in viral scenarios)
-   **Key Insight:** Direct cash incentives are expensive and have diminishing returns at scale. A tiered, ownership-based model provides a more powerful and sustainable incentive.

| Channel                     | CPA (Direct) | CPA (Optimized)    | Notes                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :----------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Paid Ads (e.g., FB/Google)**  | \$3–\$5    | \$1.00–\$1.50      | High initial cost, scales predictably        |
| **Promoted Petitions**          | \$2–\$4    | \$0.75–\$1.25      | Leverages existing platforms (e.g., Change.org) |
| **Referral / Affiliate Payouts**| \$1–\$3    | \$0.50–\$0.75      | Lower fraud, higher engagement                |
| **Total**                   | **$1.50–$2** | **$0.45–$0.65**    | Can drop to $0.20–$0.30 in best case          |

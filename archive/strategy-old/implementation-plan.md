# dFDA Implementation Plan: Privacy-Preserving Treatment Review Aggregation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating a privacy-preserving system that aggregates treatment reviews from client apps to rank treatments by effectiveness.

## 1. Standardized Identifiers & Sources

### 1.1 Decentralized Identifier System

- [ ] Implement content-addressable identifiers (e.g., using IPFS CIDs or similar)
- [ ] Create canonical naming system for treatments, conditions, and symptoms
- [ ] Version control for identifier changes and updates
- [ ] Mapping system between different naming conventions (e.g., ICD-10, SNOMED CT)

### 1.2 Treatment Source Tracking

- [ ] Source metadata schema:

```typescript
interface TreatmentSource {
  id: string; // Unique source identifier
  name: string; // Source name (e.g., "Walgreens", "CVS", "FDA")
  type: "manufacturer" | "retailer" | "pharmacy" | "regulatory" | "research";
  url?: string; // Where to get the treatment
  verificationStatus: "verified" | "unverified" | "disputed";
  qualityMetrics?: {
    gmpCertified?: boolean; // Good Manufacturing Practice
    thirdPartyTested?: boolean;
    regulatoryApprovals?: string[];
    batchTesting?: boolean;
  };
  costRange?: {
    min: number;
    max: number;
    currency: string;
    lastUpdated: string;
  };
}
```

### 1.3 Identifier Registry

- [ ] Public registry of all known identifiers
- [ ] Bidirectional mapping between common medical vocabularies
- [ ] API endpoints for identifier resolution
- [ ] Contribution system for adding new identifiers
- [ ] Verification process for identifier accuracy

### 1.4 Source Verification System

- [ ] Source verification criteria
- [ ] Quality assessment metrics
- [ ] Community feedback mechanism
- [ ] Dispute resolution process
- [ ] Regular source auditing

## 2. Privacy & Identity

### 2.1 Zero-Knowledge Identity System

- [ ] Implement zero-knowledge proof system for user identity verification
- [ ] Create privacy-preserving user fingerprinting:

```typescript
interface AnonymousUserProof {
  // Proof that the user is human (e.g., using zk-SNARK)
  humanityProof: string;

  // Deterministic but anonymous identifier derived from user's identity
  // Different apps can generate the same ID for the same user without knowing who they are
  deterministicId: string;

  // Proof that this ID belongs to the user without revealing their identity
  ownershipProof: string;

  // Optional: age/location attestation for regulatory compliance
  // Proves user is in allowed jurisdiction/age without revealing specific details
  attestations?: {
    minimumAge?: string; // Proof user is above required age
    jurisdiction?: string; // Proof user is in allowed jurisdiction
  };
}

interface TreatmentSubmissionProof {
  // Proves this is a real treatment experience without revealing user
  experienceProof: string;

  // Proves user hasn't submitted this treatment data before
  uniquenessProof: string;

  // Timestamp of experience with proof of ordering
  // Allows temporal analysis without revealing exact dates
  timeProof: {
    orderProof: string; // Proves chronological order of events
    periodProof: string; // Proves experience falls within claimed period
  };

  // Optional: Proof of relevant medical conditions
  // Allows filtering by patient characteristics without revealing specifics
  conditionProofs?: Array<{
    conditionId: string;
    validityProof: string;
  }>;
}
```

### 2.2 Deduplication System

- [ ] Implement privacy-preserving data deduplication:
  - Use deterministic anonymous IDs to identify same user across apps
  - Maintain Merkle tree of all submissions per user
  - Check new submissions against existing proofs
  - Allow users to prove they haven't submitted before
- [ ] Create submission verification system:
  - Verify proofs of real experience
  - Check temporal consistency
  - Validate condition attestations
  - Ensure regulatory compliance

### 2.3 Privacy-Preserving Analytics

- [ ] Implement secure aggregation protocols:
  - Use homomorphic encryption for aggregate calculations
  - Ensure k-anonymity in all reported statistics
  - Implement differential privacy for sensitive metrics
- [ ] Create secure multi-party computation system:
  - Allow multiple apps to contribute data without revealing individual user data
  - Enable cross-app analytics without compromising privacy
  - Support federated learning for treatment effectiveness models

### 2.4 User Rights & Control

- [ ] Implement user data management:
  - Allow users to prove ownership of their submissions
  - Enable users to update or remove their data using zero-knowledge proofs
  - Support data portability without compromising anonymity
- [ ] Create audit system:
  - Maintain public log of all proofs and verifications
  - Enable users to verify their data handling
  - Support regulatory compliance verification

## 1. API Infrastructure

### 1.1 Client App Registration System

- [ ] OAuth2 authentication system for client apps
- [ ] Client app registration portal
  - Application name
  - Organization details
  - Platform information
  - Data types provided
- [ ] Client credential management
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation

### 1.2 Data Ingestion API

- [ ] Treatment data endpoint (`/api/v1/treatments/aggregate`)
  - Validation for required fields
  - Data format verification
  - Rate limiting
  - Error handling
- [ ] Batch ingestion support for multiple treatments
- [ ] API versioning system
- [ ] Data validation endpoints

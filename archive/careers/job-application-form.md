# dFDA Mission Lead Application

**Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success..**

We are looking for the founding **Supreme Allied Commander, War on Disease**. 

The mission is to architect and build an army of AI agents to achieve a singular, near-impossible objective: mobilize 3.5% of the global population and create a self-sustaining financial engine to fund a perpetual war on human suffering.

This is a hands-on command role. Only those with world-class engineering ability, a tolerance for extreme ambiguity, and unwavering resilience should apply.

## About the dFDA Initiative

The Decentralized FDA (dFDA) initiative aims to accelerate medical progress by 80x through decentralized, automated clinical trials using real-world data. Key goals include reducing trial costs by 50-70% (from an average of \$2.6 billion per drug), providing personalized treatment recommendations, and ensuring transparency in drug evaluation [Source: Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, 2016](https://csdd.tufts.edu/csddnews/2016/3/10/march-10-2016-tufts-csdd-assessment-of-cost-to-develop-and-win-marketing-approval-for-a-new-drug-now-published). This role involves leading efforts to mobilize 3.5% of the global population for participation and funding.

## Key Responsibilities

- Architect and oversee AI agent systems for data collection, analysis, and trial automation.
- Develop strategies for global participant mobilization and donor conversion.
- Design economic models and incentives for self-sustaining funding.
- Coordinate with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance and reform pathways.
- Lead X-Prize competition development to incentivize dFDA implementation.

## Minimum Requirements

- Bachelor's degree in computer science, public health, or related field.
- 5+ years in AI engineering or data systems development.
- Experience with full-stack web development (e.g., React) and API design.
- Proven track record in leading technical projects with ambiguous requirements.

## Preferred Qualifications

- Advanced degree in AI, data science, or biomedical engineering.
- Experience in blockchain or smart contracts for data transparency.
- Familiarity with clinical trial regulations (e.g., FDA guidelines).
- Participation in AI-related hackathons or open-source projects.

## Compensation and Benefits

Competitive salary range of \$80,000-\$120,000 annually, based on experience and aligned with nonprofit med-tech roles (average \$100,000) [Source: Payscale Med-Tech Salary Report, 2023](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Medical_Devices/Salary). Benefits include remote work options, professional development stipends, and health coverage. The role offers opportunities for high impact, with potential to save lives through accelerated research (e.g., reducing drug approval time from 10-15 years to 2-3 years).

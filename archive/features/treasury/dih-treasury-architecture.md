## Purpose

The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) operates a global treasury to subsidize decentralized clinical trials, fund open-source infrastructure, and manage prizes and bounties. To earn durable trust, the treasury must be credibly neutral, censorship-resistant, and resilient—approaching "Bitcoin-level" decentralization in practice. This page specifies the treasury architecture: custody, controls, governance hooks, auditing, and incident response.

## Design Goals

- **True decentralization from day one**: No human signers controlling treasury operations.
- **Eliminate human targets**: No individuals who can be kidnapped, threatened, or corrupted.
- **Proven at scale**: Use battle-tested models from MakerDAO, Uniswap, and Aave managing billions.
- **Transparency by default**: On-chain policies, open reporting, real-time dashboards.
- **Community sovereignty**: Every VICTORY bond holder has direct control over treasury decisions.

## Chain and Asset Strategy

- **Settlement layer**: Ethereum mainnet or a high-security L2 with mature tooling and decentralization guarantees.
- **Stable unit-of-account**: Diversified basket of reputable, fully-backed stablecoins and short-duration treasuries via tokenized T-bills; explicit counterparty risk limits.
- **Segregated wallets**: Distinct vaults for operating budget, subsidies, bounties, and reserves.

## Decentralized Treasury Control: Proven DAO Model

- **Primary control**: VICTORY bond holder governance with automated smart contract execution (following MakerDAO/Uniswap model).
- **No human signers**: Treasury operations controlled directly by community votes, eliminating kidnapping/corruption targets.
- **Governance infrastructure**: Gnosis Safe modules or similar that execute based on verified on-chain voting results.

### Token Holder Governance

- **Voting weight**: Proportional to VICTORY bond holdings with quadratic voting options to prevent whale dominance.
- **Proposal system**: Any token holder can propose spending, with minimum token threshold to prevent spam.
- **Execution**: Smart contracts automatically execute approved proposals after timelock period.
- **Emergency governance**: Higher threshold (67%+ of circulating tokens) required for emergency actions.

### Safeguards

- **Timelocks**: Mandatory 24–72h delay for large transfers above policy thresholds (no human intervention required).
- **Automated circuit breakers**: Smart contract modules that pause operations based on anomaly detection.
- **Spending limits**: Daily/weekly caps per vault enforced by smart contracts; autonomous micro-spend module for low-risk bounties.
- **Token holder override**: Emergency pause/unpause controlled by supermajority token vote, not individuals.

## Governance Interfaces

- **Proposal lifecycle**: On-chain proposals referencing signed, hash-committed budgets and vendor terms. Quorum and approval thresholds defined in the DAO constitution.
- **Module separation**: Upgrades gated by higher quorum; no emergency upgrade authority without two-tier approvals and time delay.
- **Moving beyond coin-voting**: Explore identity- and contribution-weighted voting to mitigate plutocracy risks ([Buterin, 2021](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html)).

## Auditing and Transparency

- **Open accounting**: All treasury addresses published; standardized tags for disbursements; hash-committed invoices.
- **Dashboards**: Real-time inflow/outflow, runway, subsidy allocation, and grant milestones.
- **Independent reviews**: Annual smart contract audits and semiannual operational audits with published reports.

## Incident Response

- **Runbooks**: Public emergency procedures for key compromise, oracle failure, or exploit.
- **Compensation fund**: Capped reserve for remediation with predefined governance path.

## Relationship to the 1% Treaty and VICTORY Bonds

- **Funding path**: Initial capitalization via VICTORY bond/token issuance; long-term repayment and sustainability via 1% Treaty contributions.
- **Cross-references**: See [Victory Bonds Incentive Mechanics](../../strategy/1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md) and [The 1% Treaty](../../strategy/1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty.md).

## Key External Benchmarks

- **Global military expenditure**: \$2.443 trillion (2023) and \$2.718 trillion (2024), per [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2024/global-military-spending-surges-amid-war-rising-tensions-and-insecurity) and [SIPRI 2025 press release](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/unprecedented-rise-global-military-expenditure-european-and-middle-east-spending-surges).

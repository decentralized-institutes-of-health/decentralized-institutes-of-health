# AI-Driven Regulatory Impact Analysis System

## Vision

To fulfill the mandate for comprehensive health and economic impact analysis of all FDA regulatory instruments (as outlined in Section 405(e) of the "Right to Trial & FDA Upgrade Act") with maximum efficiency, transparency, and public engagement. This system leverages a lean, AI-centric approach based on the Pareto (80/20) principle, focusing on current and rapidly advancing AI reasoning and tool-use capabilities.

## Core Components & Workflow

1. **Data Science AI Agent:**
    * **Capabilities:** Equipped with a state-of-the-art reasoning Large Language Model (LLM).
    * **Tool Use:**
        * Can perform targeted web searches to gather global evidence, data, and existing models.
        * Can execute Python code for data processing, statistical analysis, quantitative modeling (e.g., QALYs, ICERs), and generating visualizations.
    * **Interaction:** Can be prompted and guided by human experts (health economists, policy analysts) to perform complex analytical tasks.

2. **Open Source Workflow & Collaboration:**
    * **Version Control:** All analytical scripts, models, data inputs (where permissible), and reports will reside in a public GitHub repository.
    * **Reporting Format:** Analyses and reports will be generated in Markdown format for ease of versioning, review, and web publishing.
    * **Public Engagement:**
        * The GitHub repository will accept public comments on analyses via Issues.
        * Pull requests for improvements, corrections, or alternative models can be submitted by the public.
    * **Democratic Governance:** GitHub Actions can be configured to manage a democratic review and merging process for community-contributed pull requests, potentially involving a designated review committee or voting mechanism.

3. **Transparent Publishing:**
    * **Static Site Generation:** Approved reports and analyses will be automatically published to a static website using GitHub Pages, ensuring broad public accessibility.
    * **Data and Model Availability:** All underlying data (where public), assumptions, and models (scripts, algorithms) will be linked or included with the published reports, fostering reproducibility and further research, consistent with Sec. 405(e)(4)(C) of the Act.

## Operational Principles

* **Iterative Development:** Start with core functionalities and incrementally enhance the system's capabilities and the complexity of analyses performed.
* **Focus on Automation:** Maximize the automation of data gathering, routine analysis, and report generation to free up human experts for higher-level tasks, interpretation, and validation.
* **Community Leverage:** Actively encourage and facilitate contributions from the broader scientific and public communities to improve the quality, scope, and relevance of the impact analyses.
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Prioritize open-source tools and lean operational practices to minimize costs while maximizing output and transparency.

## Alignment with the Act

This system directly addresses the requirements of Section 405(e) for:

* Systematic review of global evidence (AI-assisted web search and data extraction).
* Quantitative modeling (AI-executed Python scripts).
* Use of advanced analytical tools, including AI (core of the system).
* Open-sourcing of software, algorithms, data inputs, and models (GitHub repository).
* Public inspection, contribution, and collaborative improvement (GitHub issues, pull requests, Actions).
* Public availability of analyses in a user-friendly format (Markdown reports on GitHub Pages).

While the Act also mentions dedicated resources and independent oversight (Sec. 405(e)(4)(A) and Sec. 405(e)(5)), this AI-driven system provides the core technical engine and public interface for performing and disseminating the analyses in a highly efficient and transparent manner. The institutional framework for oversight and resource allocation would complement this technical system.

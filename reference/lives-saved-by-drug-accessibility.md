### **Notes on Estimates:**

1. **Naloxone**: Data is based on the U.S. opioid epidemic; global figures may be higher.
2. **Oral Contraceptives**: Maternal mortality figures are global, with most deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
3. **PrEP and PEP**: Estimates are based on the reduction of HIV/AIDS transmission in high-risk populations.
4. **Misoprostol**: Prevents deaths from postpartum hemorrhage and unsafe abortion complications globally.
5. **Hydroxyurea**: Focused on sickle cell disease patients, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
6. **Statins and Aspirin**: Based on reductions in cardiovascular disease-related deaths.
7. **Ivermectin**: Preventable deaths from parasitic diseases like river blindness and scabies, mostly in low-income countries.
8. **Epinephrine and Albuterol**: Primarily emergency treatments for preventable deaths in allergic and respiratory emergencies.

This table highlights the profound public health impact that could result from removing barriers to access for these drugs.

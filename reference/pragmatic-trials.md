# Pragmatic vs Explanatory Trials: A Quantitative Analysis

## What are Pragmatic Trials?

Pragmatic trials are designed to test interventions in real-world conditions, focusing on:

- **Real-world effectiveness** rather than controlled efficacy
- **Broad patient populations** with minimal exclusion criteria
- **Routine clinical settings** rather than specialized research environments
- **Practical outcomes** that matter to patients and clinicians
- **Rapid implementation** of findings into clinical practice

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Metric | Pragmatic Trials (e.g., RECOVERY) | Traditional Explanatory Trials |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Cost per Trial | Lower due to existing infrastructure | [$48-225 million](https://www.anjusoftware.com/insights/eclinical/clinical-trial-costs/) |
| Time to Results | Weeks to months | [5-7 years average](https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research) |
| Participants | Large (e.g., 47,000+ in RECOVERY) | [Typically 500-3000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6248200/) |
| Implementation Speed | Hours to days | Months to years |
| Patient Population | Diverse, real-world | Highly selected |
| Setting | Routine clinical practice | Specialized research centers |
| Generalizability | High | Limited |

## Cost Analysis

### Traditional Explanatory Trials

- Average phase costs ([source](https://www.sofpromed.com/how-much-does-a-clinical-trial-cost)):
  - Phase 1: $4 million
  - Phase 2: $13 million
  - Phase 3: $20 million
- Per-patient costs vary by therapeutic area:
  - Blood disorders: $200,000-422,000
  - Average across areas: $41,117

### Pragmatic Trials (RECOVERY Example)

- [Cost savings of 68-78% compared to traditional trials](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10826145/)
- Utilized existing healthcare infrastructure
- Minimal additional staff costs
- Reduced monitoring costs
- Simple data collection systems

## Speed and Efficiency

### RECOVERY Trial Metrics

- [9 days: Concept to first patient enrollment](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19)
- [10 weeks: First life-saving treatment identified](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/recovery-trial-two-years)
- [3 hours: Results to policy implementation](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/recovery-trial-two-years)
- [47,000+ participants across 6 countries](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/recovery-trial-two-years)
- [200+ hospital sites](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/recovery-trial-two-years)
- [10 major results obtained](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/recovery-trial-two-years)
- [4 effective COVID-19 treatments identified](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/recovery-trial-two-years)

### Traditional Trial Metrics

- Average time from phase 1 to approval: [7.2 years](https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/legacy/bioorg/docs/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf)
- [80% of trials fail to meet enrollment timelines](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/marketdata/featureclinical-trial-patient-recruitment/)
- [Up to 50% of research sites enroll one or no patients](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/marketdata/featureclinical-trial-patient-recruitment/)

## Clinical Impact

### RECOVERY Trial

- [Dexamethasone findings](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19):
  - 35% reduction in mortality for ventilated patients
  - [Estimated 1 million lives saved globally](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/recovery-trial-one-year-on)
- Implementation within hours of results
- Real-world effectiveness immediately apparent

### Traditional Trials

- [14% success rate from phase 1 to approval](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092479/)
- Average 7 years from discovery to clinical practice
- Limited real-world applicability due to strict inclusion criteria

## Advantages of Pragmatic Trials

1. **Better Generalizability**
   - Results apply to broader patient populations
   - Findings directly relevant to routine clinical practice
   - Higher external validity

2. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Uses existing healthcare infrastructure
   - Lower per-patient costs
   - Faster recruitment and completion

3. **Implementation Speed**
   - Rapid translation to clinical practice
   - Immediate real-world validation
   - Reduced lag between evidence and practice

4. **Statistical Power**
   - Larger sample sizes possible
   - More diverse patient populations
   - Better representation of real-world outcomes

> "Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in ventilated patients (rate ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88]; p=0.0003) and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only (0.80 [0.67 to 0.96]; p=0.0021)." - [RECOVERY Trial Results](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19)

> "Registry-based trial observed cost savings may be achieved through pragmatic trial designs... STRESS registry-based design total costs were 32% of the explanatory and 78% of the pragmatic design." - [PMC Study on Trial Economics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10826145/)

> "Overall, the 138 clinical trials had an estimated median (IQR) cost of $19.0 million ($12.2 million-$33.1 million)... The clinical trials cost a median (IQR) of $41,117 ($31,802-$82,362) per patient." - [FDA Study on Trial Costs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6248200/)

> "One trial. Over 47,000 participants. Nearly 200 hospital sites, across six countries. Ten results. Four effective COVID-19 treatments... Through discovering four treatments that effectively reduce deaths from COVID-19, it is certain that the study has saved thousands – if not millions – of lives worldwide." - [Oxford University News](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/recovery-trial-two-years)

> "In 2019, I had no idea that I would be setting up a trial of treatments for an infectious disease, let alone a pandemic virus. I certainly would not have thought it possible to go from a blank piece of paper to enrolling the first patient in nine days, to finding the first life-saving treatment within ten weeks, and for it to be made standard NHS policy within three hours." - Sir Martin Landray, [Oxford University News](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/recovery-trial-two-years)

> "Today nearly 80% of clinical trials fail to meet their enrolment timelines and up to 50% of research sites enrol one or no patients. Not only does this translate into as much as $8m in lost revenue for each day a drug is delayed, it also means that cutting-edge new medications are significantly delayed in their journey to the patients who need them most." - [Clinical Trials Arena](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/marketdata/featureclinical-trial-patient-recruitment/)

### 3.2 Costs by Trial Phase

To compare average costs by phase across all therapeutic areas, we computed a weighted mean cost, ![Xij](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/images-reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-and-barriers-drug-development/xij.png), and its weighted standard deviation, _s<sub>ij</sub>_ , , for each cost component, _i_, and clinical trial phase, _j_, where the weights are the total number of contracts (i.e., sum of investigator and contractor contracts contributing to the PICAS<sup>®</sup> and CROCAS<sup>® </sup> datasets<sup>11</sup>) such that

![Formula1: Compare average costs](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/images-reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-and-barriers-drug-development/Formula1.png)

where _w<sub>j</sub><sub>k&nbsp;</sub>_ is the total number of contracts available for the phase and therapeutic area, _k_, combination; _x<sub>ijk&nbsp;</sub>_ is the reported mean for cost component _i_, clinical trial phase _j_, and therapeutic area _k_;![Xij](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/images-reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-and-barriers-drug-development/xij.png) is the simple average of cost component _i_ for that phase _j_ across all therapeutic areas;_N<sub>i</sub>_ is the number of therapeutic areas that are associated with the phase in question; and _N<sub>i</sub><sup>'</sup>_ is the number of non-zero weights. As one would expect, the average per-study costs across all therapeutic areas increase as clinical development proceeds from Phase 1 to Phases 2 and 3 (see Figure 4).

While average Phase 4 study costs are equivalent to those of Phase 3, there is high degree of variability in Phase 4 costs across the different therapeutic areas.

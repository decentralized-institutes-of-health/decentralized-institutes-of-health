### 3.4 Conclusions

Our study suggests that therapeutic area as well as number and types of clinical procedures involved are the key drivers of costs in Phase 1 through Phase 4 studies. The therapeutic areas with the highest per-study costs in Phase 1 is immunomodulation ($6.6 million), in Phase 2 is hematology ($19.6 million), in Phase 3 is pain and anesthesia ($52.9 million), and in Phase 4 is respiratory system ($72.9 million). Figure 5 presents an overview of the different types of costs constituting each phase and their magnitudes. The denoted error bars represent one standard deviation below and above the mean value.

Excluding site overhead costs and costs for sponsors to monitor the study, the top cost drivers of clinical trial expenditures across all study phases are _Clinical Procedure_ (15 to 22 percent), _Administrative Staff_ (11 to 29 percent), _Site Monitoring_ (nine to 14 percent), _Site Retention_ (nine to 16 percent), and _Central Laboratory_ (four to 12 percent) costs (see Table 2 above).

## 4 Barriers to Clinical Trials

Broadly speaking, the major obstacles to conducting clinical trials in the United States identified through this research include: high financial cost, the lengthy time frames, difficulties in recruitment and retention of participants, insufficiencies in the clinical research workforce, drug sponsor-imposed barriers; regulatory and administrative barriers, the disconnect between clinical research and medical care, and barriers related to the globalization of clinical research. We discuss each of these in further detail below.

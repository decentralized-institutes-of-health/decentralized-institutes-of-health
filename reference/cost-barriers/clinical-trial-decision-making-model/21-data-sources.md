### 2.1 Data Sources

In constructing an operational model of clinical trial decision-making, we compiled information from a variety of sources, including:

- Publically available literature;
- Interviews with experts, FDA personnel, drug sponsors, clinical research organizations (CROs) as well as major academic clinical research centers;
- April 2012 FDA public hearing on the subject of Modernizing the Regulation of Clinical Trials and Approaches to Good Clinical Practice;
- Medidata Solutions databases;
    - Medidata Grants Manager<sup>® </sup> (PICAS<sup>®</sup> )
    - Medidata CRO Contractor<sup>®</sup> (CROCAS<sup>®</sup> )
    - Medidata Insights<sup>™</sup>

More information on the above data sources are provided below

#### 2.1.1 Publically Available Literature

Although the literature on the early stages of the pharmaceutical decision-making process is not extensive, there is some research that has characterized the process. We used this information to help define the components of the model. Some examples are the work performed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Biomedical Innovation and the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), a public-private partnership organization hosted by Duke University.<sup>4</sup>

Our literature search targeted several categories of literature: peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals, unpublished papers and presentations, white papers, gray literature, and news stories and occasional pieces appearing in newspapers and magazines or other print media outlets. Our search methodology featured systematic inquiries of the following databases:

- PubMed for peer-reviewed healthcare and biomedical journals;
- Lexis/Nexis academic for mass media and other periodical publications; and
- PAIS, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Embase for gray literature.

The search strategies differed for each category of literature and related database, but each query employed search terms in various combinations using logic strings, such as “clinical trial AND cost\*,” “barrier\* AND clinical trials,” “phase 1 clinical trial\* AND cost\*,”etc.

<sup>4</sup> CTTI comprises more than 60 organizations from across the clinical trial enterprise. Members include representatives of government agencies (the FDA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Office of Human Research Protections, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other national and international governmental bodies), industry representatives (pharmaceutical, biotechnology, device, and clinical research organizations), patient advocacy groups, professional societies, investigator groups, academic institutions, and other interested parties (Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), 2011).

### 2.1.2 Discussions with Experts, FDA Personnel, Drug Sponsors, Contract Research Organizations (CROs), and Academic Clinical Research Centers

Some of the information needed to characterize the decision process of a drug sponsor came from semi-structured discussions with our team of experts and other industry experts, FDA personnel, drug sponsors, CROs, and primary clinical research centers, including University of Massachusetts, Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan, and the Mayo Clinic.

As the decision process varies between pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as small and large firms, we interviewed representatives from these sectors and company sizes. We limited the number of interviews involving the same set of questions to fewer than 10. In total, we interviewed representatives from four small pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies; two large pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies; two CROs; and three independent expert consultants in addition to our team of experts. The expertise of those interviewed covered a wide range of therapeutic areas, including arthritis/pain/inflammatory diseases, cardiology, gastroenterology, immunology, metabolic diseases, ophthalmology, oncology, and infectious diseases. Of the six pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies interviewed, three had only a single U.S. office, while the other three had offices in multiple countries, which, in combination, span six continents.

We first emailed potential participants a cover letter explaining the purpose of the study and encouraging participation in our interviews. Almost everyone contacted for the study agreed to be interviewed. Next, we scheduled interviews with those who responded and were willing to participate. Appendix A presents the protocol used in these interviews. In general, the questions asked in each interview were targeted to the background of the interviewee, but most interviewees were asked about all three topic areas (the clinical trials decision-making process, barriers, and costs).

From these interviews, we collected information about how sponsors make the decision to move forward with the development of a new drug, the significance (in the respondents’ opinion and experience) of various cost components and barriers mentioned in the literature, and the types of changes they would advocate to address what they perceive as the most problematic barriers to conducting clinical trials in the U.S. This information helped us refine our model and was also used to more fully characterize the barriers to clinical trials and develop a list of potential barrier mitigation strategies.

In addition to our interviews with industry representatives, we also spoke with individuals involved in CTTI and the MIT Center for Biomedical Innovation (as noted earlier; specifically, the New Drugs Development Paradigm project). These groups are working to enhance the drug development process through joint research with stakeholder groups in the public and private sectors.


### 2.1.3 Medidata Solutions Databases

We used three proprietary databases on clinical trial costs, which are offered by Medidata Solutions, a global provider of cloud-based solutions for clinical research in life sciences, as part of the broad set of solutions available through the Medidata Clinical Cloud<sup>™</sup>:

- Medidata Grants Manager<sup>®</sup> (PICAS<sup>®</sup> database) – PICAS provides industry-wide negotiated site cost information. It is a database of negotiated investigator grants—it includes more than 250,000 grants and contracts and 27,000 protocols in over 1,400 indications—that provides benchmarked costs typically used for clinical trial budget planning.
- Medidata CRO Contractor<sup>®</sup> (CROCAS<sup>®</sup> database) – The CROCAS database contains thousands of negotiated outsourcing contracts. It includes comprehensive data from CRO contracts—detailed across such dimensions as therapeutic area, phase, and geography.
- Medidata Insights<sup>™</sup> – Medidata Insights is the turnkey clinical analytics solution that provides advanced visualization of clinical operational performance metrics alongside company and industry benchmarks. The Insights metrics warehouse is comprised of data from more than 7,000 studies gathered seamlessly from over 120 clinical trial sponsors.

We obtained custom aggregate tabulations from Medidata by therapeutic area, phase, and geography (domestic versus international) for the full range of cost elements associated clinical trials (averages as well as variances). Cost components included cost of IRB approvals, cost of protocols, patient recruitment costs, and administrative staff costs among others. Appendix B provides the Medidata data elements and their descriptions.

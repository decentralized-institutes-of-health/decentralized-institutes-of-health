### E.3.1 High Financial Cost

- Studies estimate that it now costs somewhere between $161 million and $2 billion to bring a new drug to market.
- The aging of a larger segment of the population has resulted in a shift to chronic and degenerative disease research and an ensuing increase in development costs. Nonetheless, many companies pursue drugs for chronic diseases to have a large and steady revenue stream. Drugs for shorter-term conditions are less attractive to drug sponsors and their investors because it is less likely that the high costs of development will be recouped through revenues and earn a profit.

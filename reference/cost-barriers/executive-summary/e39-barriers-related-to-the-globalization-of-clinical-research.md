### E.3.9 Barriers Related to the Globalization of Clinical Research

- The clinical research footprint is shifting overseas.
- There are a number of factors, including cost savings and shorter timelines, driving this shift and making it cheaper and easier to conduct trials outside the U.S.
- Ethical and scientific concerns may arise when conducting studies in other countries.
- Conducting trials at multiple sites across different countries magnifies the barriers associated with multicenter trials.

### E.4 Analysis of Barriers to Clinical Trials

In selecting barriers to analyze in the context of the clinical trial decision-making model developed, we considered whether each proposed strategy could be alleviated by policies, whether the appropriate policies could be implemented or encouraged by FDA, and whether there was evidence in the literature that could be used to quantify the potential impacts of those policies on clinical trial costs. Based on these criteria, the following barrier mitigation strategies were selected for analysis in this study:

- Use of electronic health records (EHR)
- Looser trial enrollment restrictions
- Simplified clinical trial protocols and reduced amendments
- Reduced source data verification (SDV)
- Wider use of mobile technologies, including electronic data capture (EDC)
- Use of lower-cost facilities or at-home testing
- Priority Review vouchers
- Improvements in FDA review process efficiency and more frequent and timely interactions with FDA

Our analysis suggests that priority review vouchers and improvements in FDA review efficiency can help to shorten timelines, which in turn increase the expected net present value (eNPV) to the drug sponsor. Because these options affect the final stage of clinical research (mainly NDA/BLA approval), heir overall dollar value for a sponsor at the start of clinical research is much lower due to discounting. Therefore, holding everything constant, these options may be less appealing as strategies to stimulate drug development than alternatives which substantially lower costs early on in the clinical research process. Use of lower-cost facilities/in-home testing and wider use of mobile technologies appear to be most effective in reducing costs across therapeutic areas and trial phases. Use of lower-cost facilities and/or inhome testing can reduce per-trial costs by up to $0.8 million (up to 16 percent of cost per study) in Phase 1, $4.3 million (up to 22 percent of cost per study) in Phase 2, and $9.1 million (up to 17 percent of cost per study) in Phase 3, depending on therapeutic area. Wider use of mobile technologies can result in very similar maximum savings; $0.4 million (up to eight percent of cost per study) in Phase 1, $2.4 million (up to 12 percent of cost per study) in Phase 2, $6.1 million (up to 12 percent of cost per study) in Phase 3, and $6.7 million (up to 13 percent of cost per study) in Phase 4. On the other hand, loosening trial enrollment restrictions and reducing SDV efforts have smaller impacts on costs, resulting in maximum savings of less than $0.1 million to $0.2 million per trial, representing approximately one percent of perstudy costs in Phases 2 and 3.

## 1 Introduction and Background

In calendar year 2012, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 39 novel new drugs (i.e., new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biological entities (NBEs), including both novel drugs and biologics).<sup>1</sup> While 39 approvals marks the highest number of NMEs/NBEs approved since 2004, drug companies are not filing as many applications with FDA for new drug approvals as they have in the past. Over the past 10 years (2003 to 2012), the number of NME/NBE approvals per year has fallen from the previous decade’s average of 30 to 25.7 (see Figure 1). The average yearly number of NME/NBE filings has also fallen slightly over the same time period. A reduction in the drug application pipeline means fewer novel therapies in future years.

Since applications are received and filed throughout a calendar year, the filed applications in a given calendar year do not necessarily correspond to an approval in the same calendar year. Certain filed submissions are within their 60-day filing review period and may not be filed upon completion of the review.

In 2004, to help drive new drug development and increase applications for novel new products, FDA launched its Critical Path Initiative, a strategy to help advance pharmaceutical innovation. Further, in 2011, Secretary Sebelius identified as one of the priority goals of the HHS, “accelerating the process of scientific discovery to patient care,” which includes building a national network of clinical research centers to enable clinical trials of promising compounds.

Developing a new drug is a costly endeavor and the ever-increasing cost of clinical research is often cited as one of the main reasons for the slowdown in FDA application filings. It takes approximately 10 to 15 years to bring a new drug from the laboratory to the pharmacy shelf (English, Lebovitz, & Giffin, 2010). During the initial years of non-clinical testing, the sponsor completes synthesis and purification of the drug and conducts limited animal testing. Approximately one out of one thousand compounds in preclinical testing appears promising enough to induce the sponsor to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application (Eisenstein, et al., 2004). If the FDA reviews the IND and determines that it is reasonably safe to proceed, the sponsor then initiates the first phase of clinical research.

The clinical drug development stage consists of three phases. In Phase 1, clinical trials using healthy individuals are conducted to determine the drug’s basic properties and safety profile in humans. Typically, the drug remains in this stage for one to two years (DiMasi, Hansen, & Grabowski, 2003). In Phase 2, efficacy trials<sup>2</sup> begin as the drug is administered to volunteers of the target population. At the end of Phase 2, the manufacturer meets with FDA officials to discuss the development process, continued human testing, any concerns the FDA may have, and the protocols for Phase 3, which is usually one of the most extensive and expensive parts of drug development. According to one source, mean phase lengths are 21.6 months (1.8 years) for Phase 1, 25.7 months (2.1 years) for Phase 2, and 30.5 months (2.5 years) for Phase 3 (DiMasi, Hansen, & Grabowski, 2003). Once Phase 3 is complete, the manufacturer files a New Drug Application (NDA). The period between completion of Phase 3 and drug approval typically lasts one to two years; including six to 10 months for the NDA review itself (or more if the drug is not approved after the first review). Toward the end of the NDA review stage, FDA and the drug sponsor meet with an advisory committee made of experts to present data and solicit advice on drug safety, effectiveness, and labeling. Once approved, the drug may be marketed in the U.S. with FDAregulated labeling (Lipsky & Sharp, 2001). Sometimes additional studies are conducted following FDA approval, during general use of the drug by medical practitioners. These studies are referred to as Phase 4 studies in this study but are also known as post-marketing studies (Lipsky & Sharp, 2001).

The increasing cost of clinical research has significant implications for public health as it affects drug companies’ willingness to undertake clinical trials. Some researchers (Collier, 2009) argue that the rising clinical trial costs have made the industry as a whole more risk averse and less willing to take chances on novel medicines. Many drug companies are now conducting clinical trials in other countries, such as China and India, where costs can be as much as 60 percent lower. Clinical research centers are also more closely scrutinizing the types of clinical trials they will take on, with the fear that certain projects could put the center in a deficit (Collier, 2009). To increase clinical trial efficiency and reduce costs, companies have been looking at establishing effective surrogate endpoints<sup>3</sup>—as opposed to clinical endpoints, which take longer and are more difficult to monitor—to assess failures before moving to costly Phase 3 trials. They are also looking for ways to move more rapidly to electronic data capture (EDC). To improve the recruitment process, drug companies are also investigating the use of genetic markers as a way of screening who the product is most likely to be effective with and who is likely to have significant side effects before accepting human subjects into studies.

Clinical trials can be sponsored by a variety of organizations, including industry, government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), universities, and clinical research networks. Drug companies conduct clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including demonstrating safety and efficacy for new compounds, expanding the list of indications for previously approved compounds, improving market position by demonstrating superiority to other existing compounds, increasing the amount of safety and efficacy evidence for payer reimbursement, among other things.

This study examines the decision-making process for those clinical trials that are:

- Designed to demonstrate safety and efficacy for new compounds, and
- Sponsored by industry.

The primary objectives of the study are: 1) to better understand sponsors’ strategies in the design and execution of clinical trials, 2) to identify factors that may delay, hinder, or lead to unsuccessfully completed trials, and 3) to develop an operational model of clinical trial decision-making to enable examination of what-if scenarios by end-users.

<sup>2</sup> According to a technical review prepared for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the distinction between efficacy and effectiveness trials is defined as follows: “Efficacy trials (explanatory trials) determine whether an intervention produces the expected result under ideal circumstances. Effectiveness trials (pragmatic trials) measure the degree of beneficial effect under “real world” clinical settings” (RTI International, 2006).

<sup>3</sup> While clinical endpoints are target outcomes that are measured directly (such as deaths), surrogate endpoints are intended to show the effect of the drug on a physiologic process or marker that is strongly correlated with a particular disease. For instance, CD4 cell counts might be used to assess the effectiveness of an antiviral medication in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Lipsky & Sharp, 2001).

## 2 Clinical Trial Decision-making Model

The existing literature on clinical trials primarily discusses the process of performing clinical trials—including statistical design issues and coordination problems among multiple centers and disciplines—and results, but few sources offer insights regarding the decision process of the sponsor (Hammons, Hilman, Kahan, & Neu, 1985). From the perspective of a drug sponsor operating under uncertainty, we postulate that the decision to undertake a clinical trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy is likely influenced by a variety of factors including:

- Potential market size for the drug, which in turn depends on:
    - Type of condition(s) (acute versus chronic, severity) the drug would treat;
    - Size of the patient population (current and future);
    - Number of existing drugs currently on the market that treat the same condition(s) and advances in treatment;
- Existing incentives, such as the Orphan Drug Act, and fast track FDA review that affect how quickly the drug can be brought to market and offer financial incentives;
- Clinical stage (Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3) costs that are dependent on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
    - Patient accrual rates that depend upon selection criteria, the relative ease of screening eligible patients, and physician interest;
    - Administrative, physician, registered nurse (RN), and clinical research associate (CRA) capacity (i.e., number of protocols per RN/physician, number of patients per RN/physician);
    - Number of patients needed for the desired statistical precision;
    - Number of protocols;
    - Number of institutional review boards involved;
    - Number of investigator sites and their locations;
    - Cost of clinical data collection, management, and analysis;
    - Technologies for data collection and verification;
- Projected manufacturing costs upon FDA approval which would be influenced by whether the drug is a small molecule or a biologic.

The decision process for pursuing a clinical trial is also likely to vary by type of sponsor. A large established pharmaceutical company with deep pockets may be less risk averse and better positioned to undertake costly clinical trials whereas a small emerging company may find it difficult to allocate funding to clinical research, especially if the trials require a large patient population and multiple sites.

Further, some of the clinical trial pathway formulation decisions, such as which indication within a therapeutic category to target and how to time/sequence the trials, are inextricably linked to business realities. Research objectives coupled with financial circumstances can force a sponsor down a specific clinical trial pathway. For example, large established pharmaceutical companies often try to allocate resources based on the research portfolio and the potential to market the product. In contrast, small companies can be focused on whether they can finance the development and up to what point. Small companies are also often subject to results pressures from their investors, which can lead to inappropriate or “short-cut” development approaches.

The approach adopted in this study looks at the decision process from the point of view of an expected-revenue-maximizing sponsor in the face of uncertainty (or risk). As described in the following sections, the simplified clinical decision-making model incorporates the following considerations:

- Therapeutic area,
- Potential market size/revenues for the drug, and
- Clinical stage (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4) costs that are dependent on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
    - Physician and RN costs;
    - Number of patients needed for the desired statistical precision;
    - Number of IRBs involved;
    - Number of investigator sites;
    - Cost of clinical data collection, management, and analysis; and
    - Cost of clinical procedures.
- The following sections describe the data sources used (Section 2.1) in constructing the model, the conceptual framework (Section 2.2), the operational model (Section 2.3), and the model parameters (Section 2.4) in further detail.

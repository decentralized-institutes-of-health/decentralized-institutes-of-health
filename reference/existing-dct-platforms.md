# Existing Decentralized Clinical Trial (DCT) Platforms & Vendors

This document provides a non-exhaustive list of companies and platforms that offer solutions or services related to Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs). Understanding this landscape helps contextualize the dFDA initiative and its unique goals.

The dFDA aims to go beyond current DCT platforms by creating a fully integrated, autonomous, global network for continuous evaluation, potentially leveraging real-world data at an unprecedented scale and incorporating automated ranking and personalized insights. Current DCT platforms often focus on specific aspects like remote monitoring, eConsent, patient recruitment, or virtual site management within the existing regulatory paradigm.

## Key Players in the DCT Space (Examples)

* **[Science 37](https://www.science37.com/)**: Known for its Decentralized Clinical Trial Operating System (DCT OS™), aiming to provide end-to-end capabilities for virtual trials.
* **[Medable](https://www.medable.com/)**: Offers a flexible, modular platform focused on patient-centricity, supporting various DCT components like eConsent, ePRO, and telehealth.
* **[Thread Research](https://www.threadresearch.com/)**: Provides a unified platform for managing decentralized studies, including patient engagement and data collection tools.
* **[Curavit Clinical Research](https://curavit.io/)**: A Virtual Contract Research Organization (VCRO) specifically designed for designing and executing DCTs.
* **[IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/solutions/research-and-development/virtual-trials)**: A large global CRO offering specific solutions and services for virtual and decentralized trials.
* **[Parexel](https://www.parexel.com/solutions/decentralized-clinical-trials)**: Another major CRO with significant involvement in implementing DCTs and hybrid trial models.
* **[Labcorp](https://clinical.labcorp.com/decentralized-clinical-trials.html)** (incorporating Covance): Offers end-to-end DCT solutions, leveraging its extensive lab network for remote sample collection and testing.
* **[Florence Healthcare](https://florencehc.com/)**: Focuses on site enablement technology, including eBinders, eConsent, and remote site monitoring tools that support DCTs.
* **[Castor EDC](https://www.castoredc.com/)**: Provides an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system with modules supporting decentralized elements like ePRO and eConsent.
* **[Triall](https://www.triall.io/)**: Offers an eClinical platform suite integrating various tools and potentially blockchain for enhanced data integrity in DCTs.
* **[ObvioHealth](https://www.obviohealth.com/)**: Utilizes a proprietary platform and mobile app for conducting virtual trials with a focus on patient adherence and engagement.

*Note: This list is based on publicly available information and web searches as of mid-2025. The DCT landscape is rapidly evolving, and this list is intended as illustrative, not exhaustive.*

## Key Service Categories

Many companies specialize in specific aspects of DCTs:

* **Patient Recruitment & Engagement:** (e.g., Clara Health, SubjectWell, TrialX)
* **eConsent/ePRO/eCOA Platforms:** (e.g., Signant Health, YPrime, ClinCapture)
* **Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) & Wearables:** (e.g., Koneksa, Biointellisense, Current Health)
* **Telehealth Platforms:** (e.g., Teladoc Health, eVisit)
* **Home Healthcare Services & Logistics:** (e.g., Medical Research Network (MRN), Marken, Firma Clinical Research)
* **Data Management & Analytics:** (e.g., Medidata (part of Dassault Systèmes), Veeva Systems)

The dFDA vision often encompasses integrating or automating many of these functions within a single, globally accessible, continuously learning system.

## Considerations on Cost Per Patient / Trial

Estimating a precise average cost per patient or per trial for each specific platform based on publicly available data (like total funding or revenue) is generally **not feasible**. These costs are highly variable and commercially sensitive. Factors influencing cost include:

* **Trial Complexity:** Phase, therapeutic area, number/type of procedures, endpoint complexity.
* **Duration:** Length of patient participation and monitoring.
* **Technology & Services Used:** Specific modules required (ePRO, eConsent, wearables, telehealth, home nursing, logistics).
* **Geographic Scope:** Number of countries, local regulations, translation needs.
* **Scale:** Number of participants.

**General Benchmarks & Claims:**

* **Traditional Trials:** Phase III trials often cited as costing **\$15,000 - \$40,000+ per patient**.
* **DCT Aspirational Goals:** Models like the Oxford RECOVERY trial achieved costs around **~\$500 - \$1,000 per patient** by leveraging existing infrastructure and streamlined protocols. Most commercial DCTs likely fall somewhere between these extremes.
* **Efficiency Focus:** Published studies (e.g., Tufts CSDD associated with Medable data, IQVIA internal study) suggest significant financial benefits (ROI) from DCTs, often driven by **accelerated timelines** (e.g., 1-3 months faster reported by Tufts/Medable) and operational efficiencies rather than solely direct per-patient cost reduction. ROI figures cited range from **5x to 14x** the initial DCT investment in the Tufts/Medable study.
* **Platform Claims:** Some platforms mention achieving cost efficiencies. For example, **Medable** has cited customer results including **50% cost reductions**. **Science 37** highlights significant **opportunity cost savings** ($120M-$200M range mentioned in one playbook) derived from faster trial timelines and enrollment.

**Funding/Revenue as a Proxy:** Total funding or overall company revenue remain **poor proxies** for calculating per-patient/trial costs. Investment is used for growth, R&D, and operations across the entire business, while revenue reflects market pricing and includes profit margins, not just the direct cost of service delivery for a specific trial.

**Speculative Cost Tiers (Highly Caveated):**

Given the lack of direct data, the following provides a speculative framework based on relative savings compared to traditional trials:

* **Full-Service DCT Platforms (aiming to replace most traditional site infrastructure):** These platforms likely target significant savings over the \$15k-\$40k+ traditional baseline. While vendor claims (e.g., 50% reduction) and ROI studies exist, translating this to a single number is difficult. A **highly speculative range** for many commercial DCTs *might* fall **30-70% below** traditional costs for comparable complexity, potentially placing them in the **\$5,000 - \$20,000+ per patient** range. This acknowledges substantial savings but also the significant costs of comprehensive technology and services, remaining well above the idealized ~$1k RECOVERY benchmark for most applications.
* **Enabling Technologies / Specialized Tools:** Costs for these are component-based and contribute incrementally to overall efficiency. Assigning a meaningful per-patient cost range is less applicable; their value is in optimizing specific workflow parts.

**Key Takeaway:** Actual costs are highly dependent on the specific trial design and negotiated vendor pricing. The most reliable publicly documented financial advantage often relates to ROI achieved through accelerated timelines and efficiencies.

Therefore, while DCT platforms aim to reduce costs compared to traditional methods, specific, comparable per-patient cost figures for each vendor are not reliably available from public sources. Evaluation often relies on bespoke quotes based on individual trial requirements.

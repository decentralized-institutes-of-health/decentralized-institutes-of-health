# A Logical Proof That We Should Immediately Create A Decentralized FDA

Here is a formal quantitative logical proof regarding whether disease advocacy nonprofits, drug companies, and others should pause all efforts to create FDA.gov v2 and then resume normal activities enjoying a 25X higher return on future efforts:

## The Global Treatment Gap

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| People suffering from diseases globally | [2 billion](https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd) |
| Diseases without FDA-approved treatments | [95%](https://www.evidera.com/rare-disease-treatments-arent-so-rare-any-more/) |
| Annual NIH and FDA combined budget | [$60 billion](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/budget) |
| Oxford Recovery Trial cost for testing 18 COVID treatments | [$3 million](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/inside-story-recovery-how-worlds-largest-covid-19-trial-transformed-treatment-and) |
| Cost per treatment in Oxford model | $166,667 |
| Potential treatments testable annually with current budget | 360,000 |
| Actual treatments tested annually | ~2,000 |

Despite decades of funding and billions of dollars spent by the NIH/FDA:

- No comprehensive global database of clinical data exists
- No centralized repository of treatment effectiveness across conditions
- No accessible platform for sharing real-world evidence with regulators
- Thousands of potential treatment candidates remain untested

## Key Premises

| Premise | Description | Value |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| P1 | Current average clinical trial cost | [$60 million](https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/how-much-does-a-day-of-delay-in-a-clinical-trial-really-cost-) |
| P2 | Proposed FDA.gov v2 trial cost | $2.4 million (96% reduction) |
| P3 | Annual global spending on trials | [$50 billion](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-019-00008-7) |
| P4 | FDA.gov v2 development cost | $500 million |
| P5 | Adoption rate | Gradual increase over time |
| P6 | Current drug development success rate | [12% (1 in 8.3 trials)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6409418/) |

## Key Assumptions

| Assumption | Description | Value |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| A1 | FDA.gov v2 development time | 3 years |
| A2 | Adoption rate progression | Gradual increase over several years |
| A3 | Improved success rate | 15% |
| A4 | Drug development time reduction | From 10 years to 7 years |
| A5 | Annual trial spending increase (without v2) | 5% |
| A6 | Regulatory implementation timeline | Within 3-year development period |

## Quantitative Analysis

### Development Phase (Years 0-3)

- **Total Cost**: $500 million

### Adoption Phase (Years 4-8)

As adoption increases over time, we would expect:

- **Traditional trials**: Decreasing volume and increasing costs per trial
- **FDA.gov v2 trials**: Increasing volume at significantly lower cost per trial
- **Total impact**: Progressive cost savings and higher trial volumes

## Impact Summary

### Trial Volume

- **Traditional System**: Limited growth in trial numbers
- **FDA.gov v2**: Substantial increase in affordable trials
- **Total**: Significant expansion of medical research capacity

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Investment | $500 million |
| Cumulative Cost Savings (Year 8) | Billions of dollars |
| ROI (8 years) | Substantial multiple on investment |
| Trial Volume Increase | Thousands of percent |
| New Drugs (Traditional) | Hundreds |
| New Drugs (FDA.gov v2) | Thousands |
| Development Time Saved | Thousands of years |
| Diseases potentially addressable | From 5% to majority of known diseases |

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates compelling evidence for prioritizing FDA.gov v2:

1. **Drug Development**: Thousands more new drugs vs hundreds under traditional system
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Billions in savings
3. **Time Savings**: Thousands of years of development time saved
4. **Health Impact**: Potential treatments for thousands of currently neglected diseases

**Critical Opportunity Cost**: Every year we delay implementing a decentralized FDA system means:

- 358,000 potential treatments remain untested
- Millions continue suffering from treatable conditions
- Billions in healthcare costs that could be avoided
- Decades of collective human lifespan lost

# Project Management Guidelines

## To-Do List and Task Tracking

For the initial phases of the project (Phase 0 and 1), the canonical source for tracking granular tasks and to-do lists is the operational plan.

- **Primary File:** [operations/phase-0-bootstrap-plan.md](mdc:operations/phase-0-bootstrap-plan.md)

All active to-do lists and task-level items should be maintained in that file. This keeps the high-level strategy documents, like the [Canonical Roadmap](mdc:strategy/roadmap.md), clean and focused on strategic goals rather than tactical execution.

## Agent Responsibilities

The AI assistant should proactively maintain the to-do list in the primary file. This includes:
- Adding new tasks as they are defined in the conversation.
- Marking tasks as complete as they are finished.
- Updating the list to reflect any changes in strategy or priority without needing to be explicitly prompted.

## Deliverable Organization

All deliverables and documents produced for a task should be stored in the top-level directory that best matches their function (e.g., `strategy/`, `economic-models/`, `brand/`, `regulatory/`). Source code for technical deliverables should reside in separate, dedicated repositories and not in this strategic wiki.

When a task is completed, the operational plan should be updated to include a direct link to the final deliverable.

**Example:**

| Task | Owner | ... | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Draft core pitch deck summarizing the "ask" | Founder | ... | `Done` - [Link to Deliverable](../strategy/pitch-deck.md)|


## Long-Term Recommendation

While using a Markdown file is suitable for the bootstrap phase, the recommended long-term solution for managing a project of this scale is to use **GitHub Projects**. This provides a more robust and scalable workflow with features like Kanban boards, issue tracking, and pull request integration.

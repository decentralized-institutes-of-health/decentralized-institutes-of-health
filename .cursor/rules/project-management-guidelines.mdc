# Project Management & Architecture Guidelines

## To-Do List and Task Tracking

For the initial phases of the project, the canonical source for tracking granular tasks and to-do lists are the operational plans in the `operations/` directory, primarily `operations/wiki-restructuring-plan.md` for the current refactor.

This keeps high-level strategy documents, like the [Canonical Roadmap](mdc:strategy/roadmap.md), clean and focused on strategic goals rather than tactical execution.

## Information Architecture

The full, detailed guide for contributors is located at `reference/information-architecture.md`. This section provides a summary for agent use.

### Core Principles

1.  **DIH is the Overarching Brand:** The project is the "Decentralized Institutes of Health."
2.  **The 1% Treaty is the Flagship Initiative:** Content related to the treaty, its strategy, and its financial instruments belongs in `strategy/` and `economic-models/`.
3.  **The dFDA Protocol is a Key Component:** All technical specifications, features, and regulatory details of the dFDA protocol are consolidated under the `dfda-protocol/` directory.

### Decision Tree (Where to Place New Content)

-   **Is it a high-level plan, goal, or persuasive argument for the overall mission?**
    -   Yes -> `strategy/`
-   **Is it a detailed, task-level operational plan, SOP, or hiring document?**
    -   Yes -> `operations/`
-   **Is it a technical specification, feature description, or API definition for the dFDA?**
    -   Yes -> `dfda-protocol/`
-   **Is it a financial model, tokenomics document, or ROI calculation?**
    -   Yes -> `economic-models/`
-   **Is it related to partners, contributors, governance, or community engagement?**
    -   Yes -> `community/`
-   **Is it an external document, dataset, citation, or foundational definition?**
    -   Yes -> `reference/`
-   **Is it a logo, style guide, or other brand asset?**
    -   Yes -> `brand/`

## Agent Responsibilities

The AI assistant should proactively maintain the to-do lists in the canonical operational plan files. This includes:
- Adding new tasks as they are defined.
- Marking tasks as complete as they are finished.
- Updating lists to reflect changes in strategy or priority.
- When creating a task for a deliverable, first search to see if the file exists. If it does, link to it. If not, create the file in the correct directory according to the Information Architecture Decision Tree.

## Deliverable Organization

All deliverables and documents produced for a task should be stored in the top-level directory that best matches their function, as defined by the **Information Architecture Decision Tree** above. Source code for technical deliverables should reside in separate, dedicated repositories.

When a task is completed, the operational plan should be updated to include a direct link to the final deliverable.

**Example:**

| Task | Owner | ... | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Draft core pitch deck summarizing the "ask" | Founder | ... | `Done` - [Link to Deliverable](../strategy/pitch-deck.md)|

## Long-Term Recommendation

While using Markdown files is suitable for the bootstrap phase, the recommended long-term solution is to use **GitHub Projects** for more robust and scalable task management.

## Task Generation

When analyzing a file, if you identify specific, actionable improvements that cannot be resolved by a simple MOVE or RENAME, you should generate TODO comments.

- **Format:** All TODOs must be formatted as HTML comments: `<!-- TODO: [description] -->`
- **Actionable:** Each TODO should describe a concrete task (e.g., "add citations for statistics in the introduction," "rewrite this section to be more concise," "add a Mermaid diagram illustrating this flow").
- **Placement:** These TODOs will be appended to the end of the file by the orchestrating script. Do not suggest inline placements.
- **Goal:** The purpose is to create a distributed, machine-readable task list that can be aggregated and actioned by future AI agents or human contributors.

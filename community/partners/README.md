# Partners Directory

Welcome to the `/partners` directory of the Community Directory. This section serves as a central hub for all partner-related information, facilitating collaboration and communication among various stakeholders involved in the project.

## Purpose of the Partners Directory

The purpose of this directory is to provide a space where partners can:

- Introduce their organization and their role in the project.
- Share their interests and how they wish to contribute to the project.
- Find contact information and engagement details for other partners.

## How to Use This Directory

To ensure effective collaboration and organization, we encourage each partner to create a Markdown page within this directory. The page should include:

- An introduction to the partner or organization.
- A description of their role and interest in the project.
- Preferred contact information or instructions on how they wish to be engaged.

   - Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes for review.

### Templates

## Directory Maintenance

- This directory will be regularly updated to ensure it remains relevant and useful for all partners.

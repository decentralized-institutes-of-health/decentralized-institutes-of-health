## Purpose of this Folder

The purpose of this folder is to:

- Serve as a central hub for researchers to find and share information.
- Facilitate collaboration between researchers and other stakeholders in the project.
- Provide a repository of research materials, publications, and data sets that can be used to support the dFDA's objectives.

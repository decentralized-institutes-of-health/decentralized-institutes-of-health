# Economic Impact of Prescription-Only Classification for Safe Drugs

## Introduction  

Many medications with well-established safety profiles remain available **only by prescription**, forcing patients to incur unnecessary costs and delays. These include drugs **safer than everyday substances like alcohol or cigarettes**, yet they require a doctor’s visit for access. This requirement was intended to ensure physician oversight, but it also **imposes extra expenses and barriers** on patients and the healthcare system ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=The%20requirement%20for%20a%20physician%27s,implemented%20a%20third%20category%2C%20called)). In the United States, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines already save the healthcare system an estimated **$146 billion annually** by reducing drug costs and doctor visits ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=The%20availability%20of%20over,according%20to%20a%20new%20study)). **Without OTC options, up to 90% of people would seek medical treatment for minor ailments**, creating avoidable burden ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=%E2%80%9COTC%20medicines%20are%20a%20cornerstone,%E2%80%9D)). This analysis quantifies the **individual-level and societal costs** of keeping relatively safe drugs as prescription-only. It examines key drug categories that could be moved OTC, **direct costs to patients** (doctor visits, prescriptions, time lost), the **financial strain on insurers and healthcare providers**, **administrative overhead**, and **productivity losses**. We also compare international models where these drugs are OTC to estimate potential **cost savings**, and propose a **cost-benefit framework** to guide policymakers in drug classification decisions based on risk, cost, and access.

## Key Drug Categories Suitable for OTC Reclassification  

Certain drug categories stand out as strong candidates for reclassification from prescription to OTC due to their **low risk and high public health benefit**:  

- **Antihistamines (Allergy Medications):** Second-generation antihistamines like **loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine** are very safe and non-sedating. They were prescription-only in the past but have been switched to OTC in the U.S. and many countries. This switch proved beneficial – for example, when loratadine (Claritin) went OTC, insurers initially stopped coverage (making patients pay more out-of-pocket), but within a few years **market competition drove the OTC price lower than a typical insurance copay** ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20loratidine%20switched,difficult%20to%20predict%20a%20priori)). These drugs effectively relieve hay fever and allergies without physician supervision, and their wide OTC availability has **reduced unnecessary doctor visits** for routine allergy symptoms ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=The%20researchers%20examined%20nine%20categories,majority%20of%20OTC%20medicine%20purchases)).  
  
- **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs for Heartburn):** Medications like **omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole** at low doses treat acid reflux and heartburn. They have been available OTC in the U.S. and Europe for short-term use with excellent safety. Requiring a prescription for chronic heartburn adds little medical value but significant cost. In one case, when a health plan encouraged switching from prescription PPIs to OTC omeprazole, it saw **average savings of about $41 (40%) per prescription** fill ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10437838/#:~:text=During%20the%20first%20week%20of,increase%20in)). Several PPIs are OTC internationally, demonstrating that consumers can self-manage mild gastroesophageal reflux safely.  
  
- **Low-Dose Statins (Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs):** Low doses of statins (e.g. **10 mg simvastatin**) could be offered OTC for moderate-risk individuals. The UK pioneered this by allowing pharmacist-supervised OTC sales of 10 mg simvastatin in 2004 ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=On%20May%2012%2C%202004%2C%20the,Finally%2C%20the)). This **behind-the-counter (BTC)** model (OTC available after pharmacist consultation) led to a **significant increase in statin use and a decline in total spending on statin therapy** ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=Principal%20Findings)) ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=for%20these%20unobserved%20factors,increasing%20access%20and%20lowering%20expenditures)). More people were able to lower their cholesterol without seeing a doctor, and overall costs dropped. U.S. regulators have been cautious, but evidence from the UK shows **increased access did not compromise safety** while it improved prevention of heart disease.  
  
- **Emergency Contraception (EC):** **Levonorgestrel “morning-after” pills** are very safe and most effective when taken quickly after unprotected intercourse. Making EC prescription-only creates dangerous delays and costs. Many countries (at least **50 countries worldwide**) allow EC OTC or via pharmacists ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=pharmacists%20to%20dispense%20it%20directly,with%20pharmacy%20access%20to%20Plan)). The U.S. now permits levonorgestrel EC OTC without age restriction, which has improved timely access. Economic analyses show OTC EC is **highly cost-effective**: the average cost of an unintended pregnancy (~$1,950) far exceeds the ~$40 cost of EC. In fact, **every $1 spent on Plan B saves over $4 in medical costs** from preventing unintended pregnancies ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=Likewise%2C%20with%2074%20percent%20efficacy%2C,effective)). Removing the prescription requirement **eliminates the cost of a doctor’s visit** and increases the likelihood that women obtain EC in time ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=from%20a%20pharmacist%20in%20at,per%20use%20in%20the%20public)). One analysis found that pharmacist access to EC (versus requiring a doctor visit) could **save about $179 per use in private healthcare costs** (by averting pregnancy-related expenses) ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=has%20suggested%20that%20women%20with,9)). This represents huge savings for insurers, public programs, and patients alike, on top of the social benefits of avoiding unplanned pregnancies.  
  
- **Antifungal Treatments for Common Infections:** **Antifungals for minor infections** (for example, one-dose fluconazole 150 mg for vaginal yeast infection, or mild topical fungal infection treatments) are appropriate for OTC use. Topical antifungal creams (for athlete’s foot, ringworm, vaginal yeast) are already OTC; extending OTC access to certain oral antifungals can save many doctor appointments. In the UK, for instance, women can obtain a single 150 mg fluconazole capsule directly from a pharmacist to treat thrush, as it is approved for OTC sale for this indication ([
    Fluconazole Tablet 150mg for Thrush    | Asda Online Doctor](https://onlinedoctor.asda.com/uk/fluconazole.html#:~:text=Fluconazole%20150%20mg%20tablets%20can,counter%20for%20vaginal%20thrush)). This allows prompt, effective treatment **without a GP visit**. Fluconazole’s safety at this single-dose usage is well established, and pharmacists screen for any contraindications. By contrast, in places where it is prescription-only, a simple yeast infection forces a clinic visit and prescription fill. Other examples include mild **otc hydrocortisone or clotrimazole for skin infections** and **low-potency steroid creams**, which many countries allow OTC. Expanding OTC availability for safe antifungals and similar remedies would reduce primary care workload for minor ailments.  

*These categories are illustrative.* Many other low-risk products (e.g. certain **contraceptive pills, H₂-blocker acid reducers, mild asthma inhalers, etc.) have also been proposed for OTC status. The common thread is that their **safety profile, when used as directed, is comparable to or better than existing OTC drugs**, and certainly far safer than legal but harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol. For such drugs, requiring a prescription may no longer be justified when weighed against the costs.

## Direct Costs to Patients  

Keeping a medication prescription-only imposes several **direct costs on patients**:

- **Doctor Visit Expenses:** Patients must see a physician to obtain or renew a prescription, incurring charges or copays each time. In the U.S., the **average total charge for an office visit is about $199**, with patients paying roughly **$28 out-of-pocket per visit on average** ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=primary%20care%20physicians,saw%20a%20doctor%20was%20%24199)). Without insurance, a routine visit can cost $150–$300 upfront. These are substantial costs if the visit’s sole purpose is to secure a prescription for a medication that could be safely self-administered. Even for insured patients, a $20–$40 copay for the visit plus time and travel expenses is a burden to renew access to a common drug (for example, a refill for allergy pills or heartburn medicine).  
- **Prescription Drug Costs:** Prescription-only status can affect the price patients pay for the drug itself. If insured, the patient might pay a copay (often $10–$30) for the medicine. If uninsured, they pay the full pharmacy price, which for brand-name prescription products is often higher than equivalent OTC versions. Paradoxically, when a drug goes OTC, **insurance usually stops covering it**, which means patients pay retail; however, OTC status encourages generic competition that typically **drives down the price significantly** ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20loratidine%20switched,difficult%20to%20predict%20a%20priori)). For example, when non-drowsy antihistamines were prescription-only, patients with insurance might pay a $10 copay (while the insurer paid perhaps $80). Once they went OTC, initial retail prices were around $15–$20, but within a few years generic loratadine could be bought for only a few dollars ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20loratidine%20switched,difficult%20to%20predict%20a%20priori)) – ultimately **cheaper than the old copay**. Thus, the short-term effect of OTC switches can be a shift in who pays (patient vs insurer), but the long-term effect is **lower drug prices for patients** due to competition ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20loratidine%20switched,difficult%20to%20predict%20a%20priori)). If a drug remains prescription-only, patients may actually spend more over time through copays or higher brand pricing, in addition to paying for doctor visits.  
- **Time Costs and Lost Productivity:** Seeking a prescription consumes patients’ time. Scheduling the appointment, traveling to the clinic, waiting, and consulting with the doctor can take hours. A Harvard study found the **average medical appointment takes about 121 minutes of a patient’s time**, including ~37 minutes of travel and 84 minutes at the clinic ([Study: Average Doctor's Appointment Length is 121 Minutes](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2015/10/12/doctors-appointment-length/#:~:text=Study%3A%20Average%20Doctor%27s%20Appointment%20Length,average%20of%20%2443%20per%20appointment)) ([Paying for health care with time - Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/10/paying-for-health-care-with-time/#:~:text=Paying%20for%20health%20care%20with,%E2%80%9C)). The **average work-time cost of a single doctor’s visit is estimated at \$43 in lost productivity** ([How Much Time & Money Is Wasted Waiting in Doctor's Offices | Money](https://money.com/time-money-doctor-visit-healthcare/#:~:text=medical%20visit%20comes%20to%20%2443,help%20cover%20one%27s%20medical%20expenses)). This time cost often exceeds the patient’s direct monetary cost for the visit (which averaged $32 in that study) ([How Much Time & Money Is Wasted Waiting in Doctor's Offices | Money](https://money.com/time-money-doctor-visit-healthcare/#:~:text=medical%20visit%20comes%20to%20%2443,help%20cover%20one%27s%20medical%20expenses)). For hourly workers or parents juggling schedules, these indirect costs are highly consequential. For instance, a parent needing a prescription allergy medicine might have to **take half a day off work** (lost wages ~$50–$100) and pay a $30 copay, all to obtain a month’s supply of a drug that might cost $15 OTC. These hurdles can lead to patients delaying care or going without medication if the process is too onerous. In public health terms, that means worse health outcomes in some cases.  

In summary, **each required doctor visit can cost a patient on the order of \$75 or more in combined fees and lost time** ([How Much Time & Money Is Wasted Waiting in Doctor's Offices | Money](https://money.com/time-money-doctor-visit-healthcare/#:~:text=medical%20visit%20comes%20to%20%2443,help%20cover%20one%27s%20medical%20expenses)). If a stable patient needs multiple refills per year, the financial toll multiplies. By reclassifying appropriate drugs to OTC, patients **save on copays and fees, avoid unnecessary appointments, and gain quicker access** to relief – all of which improve adherence and outcomes.

## Burden on Insurance and Healthcare Systems  

Unnecessary prescription requirements also **drive up costs for insurers, employers, and public health programs**:  

- **Unnecessary Physician Visits:** Every doctor visit for a minor condition represents healthcare resources that could be used elsewhere. Out of ~992 million U.S. doctor visits annually, it’s estimated that **about 10% are for issues that could be self-managed with OTC medicines** ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Primary%20care%20physicians%20,2)). Primary care physicians themselves report that roughly one in ten visits **did not require their medical expertise** and could have been avoided by OTC treatment ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Primary%20care%20physicians%20,2)). That equates to roughly **50–100 million avoidable doctor visits each year** in the U.S. alone. These visits cost insurers (or public payers) money: the **mean insurer payment per primary care visit is about \$170** (since the $199 total minus the patient’s copay) ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=primary%20care%20physicians,saw%20a%20doctor%20was%20%24199)). The **cumulative cost** is enormous – on the order of \$10–\$20 billion spent annually on doctor visits that wouldn’t be needed if patients had OTC access to the right medicines. One analysis projected that **cutting unnecessary visits in half (a 5% reduction overall) could save \$5.2 billion in healthcare spending per year** ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=including%20%2428%20in%20out,would%20save%20overburdened%20doctors%20almost)). These savings accrue to both public programs (Medicare, Medicaid) and private insurers, which ultimately benefits taxpayers and reduces insurance premium pressures. Indeed, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association found that OTC medicines currently available already save the U.S. healthcare system **around \$95 billion annually by avoiding clinical visits** that would have occurred if those medicines required prescriptions ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=The%20availability%20of%20over,according%20to%20a%20new%20study)) ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20cost%20savings%20due%20to,CHPA)). This is a testament to how much burden is lifted by OTC availability, and **further expanding OTC classifications could amplify these savings**.  
- **Medication Costs for Insurers:** When a drug is prescription-only, insurers typically share the cost of the medication. While generics are inexpensive, many prescription-only drugs may still be under patent or priced higher for the insured market. Insurers pay pharmacy costs and processing fees for each prescription. By contrast, if a drug is OTC, insurers often do not cover it (except in special cases), meaning **patients pay out-of-pocket but often at a much lower retail price**. From the insurer’s perspective, OTC switches can be financially beneficial – they eliminate a recurring claim expense. For example, when **loratadine (Claritin)** became OTC, insurance plans saved money by not covering it, and after prices dropped, patients also paid less overall ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20loratidine%20switched,difficult%20to%20predict%20a%20priori)). Another case: when **omeprazole (Prilosec)** went OTC, a state employee insurance plan in Arkansas encouraged its use in place of costlier prescription PPIs. As a result, **OTC omeprazole quickly grew to 60% of PPI utilization and the plan saved ~40% per PPI prescription (about \$41 saved on each claim)** in the first two months ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10437838/#:~:text=During%20the%20first%20week%20of,increase%20in)). Even though usage of heartburn medication increased 17% (more people treating their symptoms), the plan’s **per-member PPI spending dropped by nearly 39%** ([
            Effects on the Cost and Utilization of Proton Pump Inhibitors From Adding Over-the Counter Omeprazole to Drug Benefit Coverage in a State Employee Health Plan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10437838/#:~:text=to%20OTC%20omeprazole%20from%20prescription,month%20of%20coverage%20of%20OTC)). Projected annually, this policy saved nearly \$4 million for ~130,000 members – **50% lower total PPI costs** for the insurer ([
            Effects on the Cost and Utilization of Proton Pump Inhibitors From Adding Over-the Counter Omeprazole to Drug Benefit Coverage in a State Employee Health Plan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10437838/#:~:text=PMPM,this%20state%20employee%20health%20plan)). This example shows that insurers and employers can **significantly reduce drug expenditures** when a safe drug is available OTC, even if more people use it.  
- **Wasted Healthcare Resources:** From a systems perspective, requiring a prescription for benign conditions diverts healthcare resources (physician time, clinic slots, pharmacy services) to low-value activities. Doctors and nurses spend time assessing simple ailments that patients could self-treat; pharmacists and insurance adjusters process claims for cheap drugs; call centers handle prior authorizations or refill requests, etc. In a strained healthcare system (notably with primary care physician shortages), this represents a substantial **opportunity cost**. One report noted that reducing minor-ailment visits from 10% to 5% of all primary care visits (saving ~26 million appointments) would **free up about 30 minutes per day for every primary care doctor** – time that could be spent on more serious cases ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=medicines%2C%20it%20would%20save%20consumers,would%20save%20overburdened%20doctors%20almost)). Likewise, health plans could redirect funds toward more critical care if they weren’t spending billions on needless consultations and prescription claims. In essence, prescription requirements for very safe drugs function like a **hidden tax on the healthcare system**, consuming dollars and clinician time that yield little medical benefit. Policy changes that safely shift appropriate care to the OTC domain would let health systems **reinvest those resources into higher-priority health services**.  

To put the impact in perspective: a comprehensive study found that across all OTC products in the U.S., **every $1 spent on an OTC medicine saves about $7.20 for the healthcare system** via lower insurance costs and fewer doctor visits ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=to%20government)). Some categories yield even greater returns – for example, OTC antifungal products were estimated to deliver an **11:1 return** in savings (every $1 saves $11) by reducing expensive prescriptions and clinic visits ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=to%20government)). For insurers and government programs, expanding OTC access for low-risk drugs is a **powerful cost-containment strategy** that can trim waste without cutting needed care.

## Administrative and Regulatory Costs  

The classification of a drug as prescription-only triggers a chain of **administrative processes** that carry their own costs. These include:  

- **Prescription Processing and Pharmacy Dispensing Costs:** Each prescription filled involves paperwork or digital processing between the doctor’s office, pharmacy, and payer. Pharmacies incur costs for dispensing a medication – counting pills, labeling, checking drug interactions, and maintaining records – which are reflected in **dispensing fees**. In U.S. insurance plans, the typical **dispensing fee paid to pharmacies is around \$10 per prescription** (e.g., Medicaid plans often reimburse about \$10–\$13 per script as a dispensing fee) ([Medicaid Covered Outpatient Prescription Drug Reimbursement Information by State | Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-prescription-drug-resources/medicaid-covered-outpatient-prescription-drug-reimbursement-information-state/index.html#:~:text=Professional%20dispensing%20fee%20is%3A)) ([Medicaid Covered Outpatient Prescription Drug Reimbursement Information by State | Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-prescription-drug-resources/medicaid-covered-outpatient-prescription-drug-reimbursement-information-state/index.html#:~:text=Professional%20dispensing%20fee%20is%3A)). This fee is meant to cover pharmacists’ time and overhead for handling the prescription. If a drug were OTC, the pharmacist’s role would be limited to a simple sale (or none at all if sold off-the-shelf), and **no insurance claim needs processing**. Multiplied over millions of prescriptions, these \$5–\$15 per-prescription overhead costs sum to a significant expense. For example, 50 million unnecessary prescriptions filled would carry on the order of **$500 million in dispensing and billing costs** alone. These administrative dollars don’t buy health improvement – they are purely the transaction cost of maintaining a prescription system.  
- **Billing and Insurance Overhead:** The U.S. healthcare system spends enormous amounts on billing, insurance verification, claims adjudication, and related administration. Research by the National Academy of Medicine found that **billing and insurance-related (BIR) costs account for about 13% of spending on physician services** and around 10% of spending for other outpatient providers ([Excess Administrative Costs Burden the U.S. Health Care System - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/excess-administrative-costs-burden-u-s-health-care-system/#:~:text=billion%20in%202009%E2%80%94about%20%24466%20billion,14)). In total, **around \$496 billion per year is spent on health care administration** (billing, insurance, and provider administrative tasks) in the U.S. ([Excess Administrative Costs Burden the U.S. Health Care System - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/excess-administrative-costs-burden-u-s-health-care-system/#:~:text=Each%20year%2C%20health%20care%20payers,annually%2C%20according%20to%20CAP%E2%80%99s%20calculations)). While not all of this is tied to prescriptions, a portion is attributable to processing pharmacy claims and managing drug benefit utilization. Every time a claim is submitted for a $10 medication, the insurer and provider incur administrative expenses that might be a few dollars themselves – a poor ratio of overhead to actual drug cost. By moving a medication OTC, **all those billing steps vanish** for that product: the patient simply purchases it. Moreover, doctor offices avoid the work of issuing refills and handling phone queries for routine prescriptions. In a more OTC-friendly system, **fewer staff are needed to code visits, file insurance claims, handle prior authorizations, and do pharmacy benefit management for these medications**. This can translate to administrative savings for clinics and insurers, and by extension lower premiums or costs for consumers. Reducing bureaucratic friction was one reason some countries introduced a “behind-the-counter” category, allowing pharmacists to dispense certain drugs without a physician, thereby cutting out the **paperwork and delays** while still providing professional oversight ([

- **Regulatory Compliance Costs:** Strict prescription requirements also entail regulatory and compliance burdens. Physicians must maintain licenses and follow prescribing protocols, including periodic check-ups for refills even when not clinically necessary. Pharmacies must track prescriptions in databases (especially for controlled substances, though the drugs we discuss are not prone to abuse). Manufacturers face higher costs to market and distribute prescription products (e.g. needing sales reps to detail doctors, or submitting periodic safety reports) compared to OTC products governed by simpler monographs. Additionally, insurance companies expend resources on utilization review programs to ensure appropriate prescribing. While these costs are diffuse, they contribute to the **overhead that makes U.S. healthcare more expensive** than it needs to be. One could argue that **regulators themselves could save resources** by not having to oversee the prescribing of drugs that pose minimal risks – focusing FDA and DEA oversight on truly high-risk medications instead. Overall, every layer of administrative handling for prescription drugs – from **the doctor’s pen to the insurance claim** – is a layer that could be trimmed for low-risk medications, yielding a leaner, more cost-efficient system.  

It is important for policymakers to note that a significant fraction of U.S. health spending (estimates range from **15–30%** of all health dollars) is tied up in administrative and billing costs ([The Role Of Administrative Waste In Excess US Health Spending | Health Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20220909.830296/#:~:text=Top%20Findings%20From%20The%20Literature)). By **right-sizing drug regulation** – keeping prescriptions only for drugs that genuinely need monitoring – we can chip away at this waste. Streamlining access to safe medications means **fewer forms, fewer transactions, and fewer intermediaries taking a cut**, which in turn can reduce overall healthcare expenditures.

## Societal Productivity Losses  

When millions of adults spend time and money on needless doctor visits, the **broader economy feels the impact**. Time that could be spent working, studying, or caring for family is instead spent sitting in waiting rooms or managing paperwork. The **cumulative productivity loss** from requiring prescriptions for safe drugs is substantial:

- **Time Away from Work:** As noted, an average physician visit consumes about **2 hours of a patient’s time** including travel ([Study: Average Doctor's Appointment Length is 121 Minutes](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2015/10/12/doctors-appointment-length/#:~:text=Study%3A%20Average%20Doctor%27s%20Appointment%20Length,average%20of%20%2443%20per%20appointment)). Often, these visits happen during standard working hours, causing employees to miss work. For hourly workers or those without flexible leave, this directly translates to lost wages. Even salaried workers experience a hit to productivity. If we conservatively assume 50 million unnecessary visits per year and ~2 hours lost each, that’s **100 million hours of lost time**. At the U.S. average hourly wage (around \$30), this equates to roughly **\$3 billion in lost productivity** annually due to time spent obtaining prescriptions for self-treatable conditions. And this is likely an underestimate, as it doesn’t count travel costs, childcare arrangements, or the cognitive load of managing healthcare logistics.  
- **Employer and Economic Costs:** Employers bear costs when workers take off for medical appointments – in reduced output or the need for coverage. A study quantified the **opportunity cost per medical visit at \$43 for the average patient** ([How Much Time & Money Is Wasted Waiting in Doctor's Offices | Money](https://money.com/time-money-doctor-visit-healthcare/#:~:text=medical%20visit%20comes%20to%20%2443,help%20cover%20one%27s%20medical%20expenses)), which reflects lost productivity. Multiplied across millions of visits, the economy is forgoing billions in output. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association estimated that the availability of existing OTC medicines provides about **$34 billion in productivity benefits** annually, largely by **avoiding work absences for doctor’s visits** ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=alone)). This figure illustrates the macro-scale impact: if those OTC medicines were prescription-only, workers would be taking far more sick time or personal time to address minor health needs. By the same token, **expanding OTC access** to more drugs would further reduce absenteeism and preserve productive work hours. For instance, enabling a cholesterol check and statin purchase at a pharmacy on a patient’s own schedule (instead of multiple clinic visits) means that person misses less work while still managing their health.  
- **Improved Health and Productivity:** In some cases, making a drug OTC can also improve adherence and health outcomes, which has long-term productivity gains. For example, more widespread use of allergy medications (thanks to OTC access) means fewer days of severe allergy symptoms, which can impair job performance or school performance. Similarly, easier access to PPIs might reduce days of work lost to gastroesophageal reflux pain. While harder to quantify, **better symptom control and disease prevention** translate into a healthier, more productive populace. One could view this as avoiding the productivity losses associated with untreated or undertreated conditions (which can happen when prescriptions act as a barrier). The self-care enabled by OTC drugs tends to keep people at work and functioning. Studies have found that when consumers treat minor ailments themselves, **health outcomes are similar, but costs and work absences are significantly lower** than if they went to a physician ([Pharmacists prove effective, less costly care option for minor illnesses](https://pharmacy.wsu.edu/2024/05/29/pharmacists-prove-effective-less-costly-care-option-for-minor-illnesses/#:~:text=Pharmacists%20prove%20effective%2C%20less%20costly,cost%20much%20less%2C%20sometimes)).  

In summary, every unnecessary hurdle in accessing medication has a ripple effect on the workforce and economy. By **minimizing those hurdles for low-risk drugs**, society can reclaim a sizeable amount of productive time. The benefit is twofold: individuals save personal time (improving quality of life), and employers benefit from reduced downtime. From a policy perspective, these productivity gains bolster the economic argument for OTC switches, complementing the direct healthcare cost savings. As one report succinctly put it, **accessible OTC medicines help people “feel better and can be more productive” in their daily lives ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=antifungal%20dollar%20provided%20over%20%2411,in%20savings)).**

## International Models and Cost Savings  

Looking abroad, we find useful examples of how reclassifying drugs to OTC (or pharmacy access) has played out in practice. Many peer countries have **more progressive OTC policies** for certain medications, yielding insights into potential cost savings and health outcomes:

- **United Kingdom – Low-Dose Statins:** The UK was the first to move a statin (simvastatin 10 mg) to behind-the-counter status in 2004 ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=On%20May%2012%2C%202004%2C%20the,Finally%2C%20the)). Pharmacists could dispense it without a doctor’s prescription to patients meeting certain criteria (moderate cardiac risk). This policy was somewhat controversial initially – a Lancet editorial argued it was mainly a tactic to **shift costs from the National Health Service to patients** ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=class%20of%20drug%20with%20important,drugs%20in%20an%20OTC%20setting)). However, empirical evidence shows the switch was a success from both an access and an economic standpoint. A difference-in-differences study comparing the UK to other countries found the **BTC statin availability led to a significant rise in total statin use (more people treated) and a **significant decline in overall statin expenditures** ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=Principal%20Findings)) ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=increase%20in%20utilization%20of%20simvastatin,robust%20to%20alternate%20model%20specifications)). In other words, **more people got preventive therapy for cholesterol at a lower total cost**. This was achieved because the OTC price of low-dose simvastatin in the UK was affordable, and many individuals who would not have qualified for prescription statins (under stricter guidelines) could still benefit modestly from the OTC statin. The increased competition and the availability of inexpensive generic simvastatin meant that even though patients were buying it themselves, the price per dose was low, and the NHS saved money by not subsidizing as many prescriptions. The UK example illustrates that with careful implementation (pharmacist guidance, proper labeling), **prescription-to-OTC switches can both improve public health (through increased access) and reduce spending**. Notably, no major safety issues were reported – consumers used the OTC statins appropriately, and pharmacists referred any high-risk or uncertain cases to physicians, maintaining a safety net. This model could inform U.S. policy, especially as American regulators consider ways to expand pharmacist-prescribing or BTC categories for drugs like statins.  

- **Global Access to Emergency Contraception:** Many countries have made emergency contraceptive pills available directly from pharmacies without a prescription, years ahead of the U.S. As of 2008, at least **50 countries** had non-prescription access to Plan B or equivalent ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=pharmacists%20to%20dispense%20it%20directly,with%20pharmacy%20access%20to%20Plan)). Studies of these international models show **no increase in misuse or adverse events**, but clear benefits in terms of timing and cost. When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finally allowed Plan B OTC (first with age restrictions in 2006, later fully OTC), it aligned the U.S. with international best practices. Economic evaluations in various countries (including the U.S.) have consistently found EC access to be **cost-saving from a societal perspective**. For example, in France and the UK, pharmacy access to EC was associated with higher usage in the needed time frame and reductions in abortions. In the U.S., **women with easier pharmacy access to Plan B were more likely to use it after unprotected sex**, preventing pregnancies and thus reducing downstream costs ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=from%20a%20pharmacist%20in%20at,per%20use%20in%20the%20public)). A decision-analysis cited by the Bixby Center estimated that **removing the prescription requirement for EC could save \$57 per use in public sector costs** and \$179 in private sector costs, by averting the expenses of unintended pregnancies over the following months ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=has%20suggested%20that%20women%20with,9)). Countries like Australia and New Zealand report similar findings – pharmacist-prescribed or OTC EC led to **cost savings for healthcare payers** and did not encourage risky behavior, but simply provided a fallback that reduced unplanned pregnancies ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=has%20suggested%20that%20women%20with,9)). These international outcomes support the argument that making safe drugs more accessible **improves health metrics and lowers costs universally**.  

- **OTC Proton Pump Inhibitors and Others:** In Canada and much of Europe, certain PPIs (like omeprazole 20 mg) and H₂-blockers (ranitidine, famotidine) have been available OTC or as pharmacist-mediated sales for years. This has normalized the self-treatment of heartburn and acid reflux. Research observed that after OTC introduction of acid reducers, there was **little adverse impact on health**; in fact, one study found **no significant change in overall utilization of appropriate therapy** – people who needed acid suppression still got it, just more often on their own terms ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=%28Sullivan%202005%20%29,Dhippayom%20and%20Walker%202006)). Meanwhile, healthcare systems saved money because fewer prescriptions were reimbursed. Similarly, **antifungal treatments** for common infections are OTC in many countries (e.g., clotrimazole and fluconazole for yeast infections in the UK, as mentioned). In those countries, it is routine for a woman to go straight to the pharmacy for thrush treatment, with doctors getting involved only if first-line treatment fails or if symptoms are atypical. This **triage-by-access** ensures doctors’ time is reserved for complex cases while routine cases are handled swiftly OTC. The cost to national health insurance is lower because the pharmacy medicine might be paid out-of-pocket (often a modest amount), and **the patient saves the cost of a doctor appointment**. Importantly, public health monitoring in these countries has not identified any significant safety problems with these practices – consumers generally use OTC drugs correctly for the indicated uses. In fact, pharmacists in countries like the UK are trained to ask a few screening questions (to rule out serious issues or pregnancy, etc.) and then provide the medication or refer to a doctor if needed ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=therapies,1)) ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=increasing%20access%20to%20beneficial%20therapies%2C,For%20example%2C%20a%20randomized)). This model effectively catches any potential misuse while still avoiding a formal doctor visit in the majority of cases.  

- **OTC Oral Contraceptives:** Although not listed in the prompt’s examples, it’s worth noting briefly that more than **100 countries** allow some form of OTC access to oral contraceptive pills (often through pharmacies) ([OTC Birth Control Pill Access World Map](https://freethepill.org/otc-access-world-map#:~:text=Birth%20control%20pills%20are%20already,States%20to%20join%20that%20list)). This is an area where the U.S. is now catching up (with an OTC birth control pill approved in 2023). Decades of international experience show that women can self-screen using checklists to determine if they have risk factors that would make oral contraceptives unsafe, and most can safely use them without a prescription. The outcomes include lower unintended pregnancy rates and cost savings in those health systems, again reinforcing the theme that **OTC access for well-understood medications leads to positive societal outcomes**.

Across these international models, a pattern emerges: **making a drug available OTC (or via pharmacists) tends to increase access/utilization, while either maintaining or improving health outcomes, and often reducing overall costs**. The **fears of harm or cost-shifting have largely not materialized** in practice. Where cost-shifting to patients did occur, policymakers found ways to mitigate it (e.g., setting an affordable price ceiling, or allowing insurance reimbursement for OTC purchases in some cases, or using health savings accounts). By studying these examples, U.S. policymakers can be reassured that moving relatively safe drugs OTC is a well-trodden path, and the evidence from abroad is that **the benefits – both economic and public health – are significant**.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework for Rational Drug Classification  

To guide policymaking, we propose a structured **cost-benefit analysis framework** to evaluate whether a prescription requirement is warranted for a given drug. Policymakers should weigh the following factors:

- **1. Safety and Risk Profile:** Evaluate the drug’s side effects, toxicity, and potential for misuse or abuse. Compare these risks to those of common OTC drugs or even substances like alcohol/tobacco. If the drug has a **wide therapeutic index and low incidence of serious adverse events**, especially when used short-term or at a lower dose, it likely can be safely used without physician supervision. Many second-generation antihistamines, acid reducers, and low-dose statins fall in this category of **very low risk**. Also consider whether **clear labeling** can mitigate risks (e.g., warnings on when not to use the drug or when to consult a doctor). **Pharmacist consultation (behind-the-counter status)** can be a middle ground for drugs that need some screening – this allows oversight on contraindications without requiring a doctor’s visit ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=the%20patient%2C%20such%20as%20the,1)). The goal is to ensure that **the safety profile justifies self-medication**. If a drug’s known risks are no worse than those of medications people already self-administer, a prescription mandate may be unnecessary.  

- **2. Clinical Benefit and Necessity of Oversight:** Determine whether routine physician monitoring or diagnostic input is critical for safe and effective use. For example, some drugs require periodic lab tests or dose adjustments (warranting prescriptions), but others effectively treat symptoms that patients can self-diagnose (like allergies or heartburn). If the **indication is easily self-recognized** (e.g., nasal congestion, occasional acid reflux, yeast infection) and the drug provides symptomatic relief or preventive benefit, then **requiring a doctor mainly adds confirmation of what the patient often already knows**. In such cases, the marginal benefit of physician oversight is low. Empirical evidence can be brought in: have other countries allowed OTC use successfully? Are there clinical trials of OTC use or pharmacist-managed use? For instance, studies show **pharmacists can effectively manage chronic conditions like high cholesterol or diabetes in collaboration with patients** ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=their%20extensive%20training%20in%20management,patients%20with%20high%20risk%20of)), suggesting that certain maintenance therapies (like low-dose statins or inhalers) could be safely initiated or continued without a doctor each time. Policymakers should also consider the public health upside of easier access: **will more people get treated or prevent disease if the drug is OTC?** (e.g., more smokers might use nicotine replacement if easily available; more at-risk people might take statins). These **health benefits** (fewer asthma exacerbations, fewer cardiac events, etc.) need to be factored in alongside safety. Essentially, **if the drug’s benefits can reach more people with OTC status, and oversight adds little incremental safety, that tilts the balance toward OTC**.  

- **3. Economic Costs and Savings:** Quantify the **direct and indirect costs** associated with keeping the drug prescription-only versus making it OTC. On the cost side for OTC, one must consider any **potential increase in out-of-pocket spending** for patients if insurance no longer covers the drug. This was seen initially with loratadine in the U.S., where patients had to pay retail ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20loratidine%20switched,difficult%20to%20predict%20a%20priori)). However, also project the likely **price reduction due to market competition** – as happened when generic OTC entries drove the price down below the old copays ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20loratidine%20switched,difficult%20to%20predict%20a%20priori)). In many cases, the **OTC price of a drug falls dramatically** over time compared to its prescription price, which benefits all consumers (including the uninsured). On the flip side, quantify the **healthcare system savings**: fewer doctor visits (savings in insurance payouts and patient time), fewer insurance claims to process, and possibly lower medication costs if cheaper OTC generics are used ([
            Effects on the Cost and Utilization of Proton Pump Inhibitors From Adding Over-the Counter Omeprazole to Drug Benefit Coverage in a State Employee Health Plan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10437838/#:~:text=During%20the%20first%20week%20of,increase%20in)) ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=including%20%2428%20in%20out,would%20save%20overburdened%20doctors%20almost)). Also include **macroeconomic benefits** like improved productivity from reduced sick leave ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=alone)). A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis would sum the expected savings in medical expenditures (insurer and patient) and productivity, and compare them to any expected increases in consumer spending on the drug or any costs of implementing the switch (such as public education campaigns, new labeling, etc.). For example, **the cost of one unintended birth far exceeds the cost of providing emergency contraceptive pills OTC**, making the net benefit huge ([](https://intranet.bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/publications/files/IsECCostEffective_2008.pdf#:~:text=Likewise%2C%20with%2074%20percent%20efficacy%2C,effective)). Similarly, if millions of visits are saved by OTC allergy meds, include the $5.2B potential savings figure as a benefit ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=including%20%2428%20in%20out,would%20save%20overburdened%20doctors%20almost)). Policymakers should aim to **monetize both the benefits and the risks**: e.g., if there is a risk of some misuse, what is the potential cost (in adverse events) and how does that compare to the savings? In most cases studied (allergy meds, heartburn meds, etc.), the **cost savings and convenience gains vastly outweigh the small risk of some improper use**.

- **4. Mitigation of Risks and Educational Needs:** If certain risks are identified (for instance, a drug could be overused or mask a serious condition), design mitigation strategies rather than using a prescription as the only control. This could mean requiring **specific labeling** (e.g. “Do not use more than 14 days” on OTC PPIs to prevent masking ulcers) and instructing pharmacists to advise on proper use. Consider if **consumer education campaigns** or packaging (unit dose blister packs to prevent overdose, etc.) can address safety concerns at a much lower societal cost than keeping the drug RX-only. The framework should account for the cost of these measures (which is typically small, like printing warnings or training pharmacists) against the benefit of OTC availability. **Pharmacovigilance systems** can also be employed – for instance, pharmacists logging sales or a follow-up program to track outcomes in the first year of an OTC switch. This would provide data and reassure regulators, essentially serving as a “post-marketing surveillance” that can catch any unforeseen issues. The key is to ensure **potential risks are actively managed in the OTC setting**, which often can be done effectively without requiring every user to see a physician.

- **5. Equity and Accessibility Considerations:** Evaluate how the current prescription requirement might affect different populations. Often, **vulnerable or uninsured groups benefit the most from OTC access**, because a doctor’s visit is a high hurdle for them (cost-wise or due to provider shortages). OTC availability means a person can walk into a pharmacy and obtain the medicine for a known condition the same day, potentially preventing complications. Policymakers should consider the **value of improved access** for underserved communities – for example, rural areas with few doctors, or teens who may be uncomfortable obtaining certain prescriptions. There is also an **equity issue in cost-shifting**: while society saves money, we must ensure we’re not unduly burdening low-income patients. One solution is to allow **insurance or flexible spending accounts to reimburse OTC medications** when recommended by a provider, or to have pharmacists prescribe and have it covered (as some systems do). The framework should highlight if an OTC switch could inadvertently leave a gap for certain patients and how to close that gap. In the UK statin case, the Lancet’s concern about cost-shifting ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=class%20of%20drug%20with%20important,drugs%20in%20an%20OTC%20setting)) underlines the need to monitor patient out-of-pocket costs. If evidence (like the Claritin case) shows that **prices will drop and generics will become available**, that can alleviate the concern ([
            Behind-the-Counter Statins: A Silver Bullet for Reducing Costs and Increasing Access? - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3447239/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20loratidine%20switched,difficult%20to%20predict%20a%20priori)) – but during the transition, assistance programs or coupons could help. Essentially, a fair cost-benefit analysis for policymaking will not only look at **total net economic benefit**, but also **who accrues the benefits and who bears any costs**. The ideal reclassification scenario is one in which **patients, payers, and providers all see net benefits**: patients get cheaper, faster access; payers spend less; providers are freed to focus on serious issues. International evidence often supports this win-win outcome when done correctly.  

- **6. Implementation Feasibility:** Finally, consider the practical steps and any one-time costs of reclassifying the drug. The analysis should list what regulatory hurdles must be overcome (e.g., an FDA OTC monograph or additional studies on consumer comprehension of the label). These are usually short-term investments. The framework would weigh these implementation costs against the recurring annual savings. For instance, if it costs \$5 million to run a public education campaign for an OTC statin (to ensure consumers understand who should take it and who should see a doctor), but it will save \$50 million per year in healthcare costs, the upfront investment is easily justified. Policymakers should also consider phasing or pilot programs – maybe start OTC sales with certain restrictions (age limits, package size limits) and then liberalize if all goes well. The cost-benefit approach can include **sensitivity analyses**: what if misuse is slightly higher than expected? What if uptake is lower than expected? Generally, for the drugs we’ve identified, even conservative scenarios yield net benefits because current costs (in money and time) are so high and current risks are so low.  

In applying this framework, the **overarching principle** is rationalizing drug schedules based on modern evidence. Each drug should be periodically re-evaluated: *Do the benefits of requiring a prescription still outweigh the costs?* If not, an OTC switch (or BTC/pharmacist access) may be the smarter choice. By quantifying factors like those above, policymakers can make decisions that are **grounded in data** rather than inertia or historical precedent. The framework also ensures that **public health and economic impacts are both given due weight** – a drug’s classification is not just a medical decision, but also an economic one.

## Conclusion and Policy Recommendations  

The evidence is clear that for many **relatively safe, commonly used drugs**, the prescription-only status is an outdated mode of control that comes at a high economic and social price. Reclassifying appropriate medications to OTC (or pharmacist-dispensed) can **save patients money, save insurers and government payers billions, reduce administrative waste, and give people back countless hours of productive time**. All the while, international experience and pilot programs show that these switches can be made **without compromising safety or effectiveness**. In fact, easier access often **improves public health outcomes** by enabling more people to treat or prevent ailments earlier.

To persuade policymakers, one must highlight both the **macro-level savings** and the **human-level benefits**. On the macro side, we’ve seen that OTC medicines already save the U.S. healthcare system on the order of **$146 billion per year** ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=The%20availability%20of%20over,according%20to%20a%20new%20study)); expanding OTC status to more drugs could amplify this. The potential savings span **drug costs (cheaper OTC generics)** ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20cost%20savings%20due%20to,CHPA)), **avoided clinical visits** ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20cost%20savings%20due%20to,CHPA)), and **productivity gains** ([OTC Meds Save Billions](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/otc-meds-save-billions#:~:text=alone)). International comparisons suggest that nations can trim significant healthcare spending by embracing OTC switches (for example, the UK’s move to OTC statins helping lower cardiovascular treatment costs). On the human side, millions of individuals would no longer have to choose between **paying for a doctor’s visit or going without relief** for a minor condition. The convenience and autonomy gained are hard to quantify but certainly valuable – a point not lost on the public, as consumer surveys often show desire for more OTC options for things like oral contraceptives or cholesterol tests.

Policymakers should also consider the current moment in healthcare: systems are overburdened, primary care access is limited in many areas, and **cost containment is a priority**. Empowering patients to handle self-care for mild illnesses aligns perfectly with these needs. It reduces strain on physicians (who can then devote time to more complex patients) ([Potential Reduction in Unnecessary Visits to Doctors from Safe and Appropriate Use of OTC Medicines Could Save Consumers and Taxpayers Billions Annually](https://www.chpa.org/sites/default/files/media/docs/2020-10/Potential-Reduction-Unnecessary-Visits-Doctors-from-Safe-Appropriate-Use-OTC-Medicines-Could%20Save-Billions-Annually-06172011.pdf#:~:text=medicines%2C%20it%20would%20save%20consumers,would%20save%20overburdened%20doctors%20almost)) and can reduce insurance expenditures (potentially translating to lower premiums or freeing public funds for other health programs). Moreover, as we shift toward a healthcare model that values **preventive care and patient engagement**, OTC availability is a tool to promote those values – patients engaged in managing their own seasonal allergies or heartburn with OTC products are practicing self-care that can prevent escalation to more serious issues.

Of course, **drug safety should remain the north star**. The proposal is not to make all drugs OTC, but to recalibrate the system. Many drugs will and should stay prescription-only due to legitimate risks. But we have likely **erred on the side of over-classification** in some cases, and rectifying that is both safe and economically wise. As a living example, consider that **cigarettes (which cause cancer) and liquor (which can be lethal in excess) are sold over the counter**, yet at one time even something like insulin (life-saving for diabetics) could only be accessed with great difficulty. Society must continually ask if our drug regulations are proportionate to the actual risk-benefit profile of substances. For antihistamines, PPIs, low-dose statins, emergency contraception, and antifungals, the evidence indicates that **the public can use these responsibly with minimal oversight** – and when they do, the **healthcare system reaps financial rewards** in the form of saved resources.

**Recommendation:** Policymakers should convene expert panels (including pharmacologists, economists, physicians, and consumer advocates) to prioritize a list of prescription drugs that could be switched to OTC or BTC status. For each, commission a thorough cost-benefit analysis as outlined, including learning from countries where those drugs are already OTC. Start with a pilot reclassification of one or two high-impact categories (for example, making a low-dose statin OTC with pharmacist consultation, or allowing an oral contraceptive OTC as recently approved). Monitor outcomes closely – both health outcomes and cost metrics. It is very likely, based on all data we have, that these experiments will show **fewer doctor visits, no significant safety issues, lower system costs, and satisfied consumers**. Such results can build momentum to reclassify more drugs.

In addition, complementary policies can maximize the benefits: ensure **OTC medicines are affordable** (encourage generic competition and consider price caps if needed for essential meds), allow **health savings accounts or insurance plans to cover certain OTC purchases** (especially preventive meds like statins or contraceptives), and invest in **public education** so people know how to use OTC options wisely and when to seek medical help. This holistic approach will address any concerns about patient misuse or cost barriers, while unleashing the full value of easier access.

**In conclusion, shifting appropriate drugs from prescription to OTC is not just a healthcare convenience issue – it is a significant economic and public health opportunity.** By updating drug classifications to reflect current knowledge and societal needs, we can *reduce unnecessary healthcare spending, streamline administrative burden, improve access to treatments, and empower individuals* in their own care. The data and international experiences highlighted in this analysis make a compelling case that such reforms would yield enormous dividends for both individual patients and society at large. It is time for policy leaders to act on this evidence and modernize our approach to medication accessibility for the benefit of all.

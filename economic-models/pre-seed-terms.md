# Pre-Seed Round: SAFT Terms

This document outlines the proposed terms for the initial, high-risk, pre-seed funding round for the War on Disease initiative. The goal of this round is to secure the capital necessary to fund the legal, operational, and recruitment groundwork for the main capital raise.

---

## 1. Overview

- **Instrument:** Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT).
- **Funding Goal:** $750,000 USD.
- **Use of Funds:** 
  - Legal entity formation in required jurisdictions.
  - Retainer for specialized legal counsel (securities, election law).
  - Salaries for the first 2-3 core team members (e.g., General Counsel, Head of Operations) for a 12-month runway.
  - Initial operational and administrative costs.

## 2. The Agreement

A SAFT is a simple, standardized contract used by early-stage crypto projects. An investor provides capital to the project today. In exchange, the project promises to give the investor a corresponding value in network tokens (VICTORY bonds) in the future, if and when the tokens are created and distributed (the "Token Generation Event").

This allows the project to raise crucial early funding before a full token system is built and valued.

## 3. Key Terms for Pre-Seed Investors

Investors in this round are taking the highest risk and receive the most favorable terms.

- **Conversion Trigger:** The SAFT will convert into VICTORY bonds at the project's main public sale (the "Phase 2 Capital Raise" outlined in the roadmap).

- **Discount Rate: 35%**
  - **How it works:** Pre-seed investors will receive VICTORY bonds at a 35% discount to the price offered to investors in the main public sale. For example, if the public sale price is $1.00 per token, pre-seed investors would receive their tokens at a price of $0.65 per token.

- **Valuation Cap: $20,000,000**
  - **How it works:** This is a protective mechanism for early investors. It sets a maximum project valuation at which their investment converts. Investors receive tokens based on the *lower* of the discounted price or the valuation cap, ensuring they are rewarded for taking the earliest risk, even if the project's public valuation becomes extremely high.

- **Pro-Rata Rights:** Pre-seed investors will be granted the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the main capital raise to maintain their initial percentage ownership of the network.

## 4. Legal Disclaimer

This document is a proposal and does not constitute a solicitation for investment. All investments are high-risk. The SAFT will be a legally binding document prepared by counsel. There is no guarantee of a future Token Generation Event or that the project will succeed. Investors should be prepared for the total loss of their investment. All participants must be accredited investors where required by law.

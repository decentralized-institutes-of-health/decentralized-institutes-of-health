# How Rx-to-OTC Switches Affect Drug Prices and Access

The transition of prescription drugs to over-the-counter (OTC) status can significantly impact drug prices and accessibility. Here's what the data shows:

## Average Price Reduction

- Studies show that drugs switching from Rx to OTC status experience an average price reduction of [36%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539854/)

## Notable Examples

- Zyrtec (cetirizine) saw prices drop by as much as [80%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539854/) after its OTC switch
- While specific price data isn't available for Prilosec, Claritin, and Flonase, their OTC switches followed similar patterns of increased accessibility and price competition

## Impact on Drug Access

Rx-to-OTC switches generally improve drug access by:

1. Eliminating the need for doctor visits and prescriptions
2. Increasing price competition from generic manufacturers
3. Making medications more readily available in retail stores

However, the economic impact varies by drug and is influenced by factors like:

- Generic competition timing
- Insurance coverage changes
- Manufacturer pricing strategies

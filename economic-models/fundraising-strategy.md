# Fundraising Strategy: Simple Targets, Sophisticated Mechanics

## 1. Executive Summary

To secure the **\$1.2–\$2.5 billion** in "activation energy" required to pass the 1% Treaty, we employ a sophisticated, multi-phase fundraising strategy. This strategy is designed to maximize the speed of capital acquisition while ensuring capital efficiency and minimizing risk for early investors.

Our approach is built on three pillars:
1.  **A Hybrid Communication Strategy:** Using simple, ambitious ROI targets for marketing to create broad appeal, while using efficient market-driven mechanisms on the backend.
2.  **De-Risking with Assurance Contracts:** Eliminating fundraising risk for early backers through a transparent, smart contract-based "money-back guarantee."
3.  **A Phased, Market-Driven Model:** Progressively de-risking the project and allowing the market to price risk and reward efficiently over time.

## 2. The Hybrid Communication Strategy

Investor psychology requires a simple, powerful message. The underlying financial mechanics require efficiency. We achieve both.

-   **Public-Facing Target (The "Hook"):** For marketing and high-level communications, we will lead with a simple, audacious, and mathematically defensible target:
    > **"We are targeting returns superior to the world's most elite hedge funds (~40% annualized), which projects to a ~28x return over 10 years. Our financial model is governed by a simple principle: investor payouts never exceed 50% of our income, guaranteeing our mission is always protected."**

    This message is designed to be memorable, signal the massive scale of the opportunity, and is credibly backed by our [Investment Thesis](./victory-bond-investment-thesis.md) and [Dynamic Cash Flow Model](./dih-treasury-cash-flow-model.md).

-   **Backend Mechanism (The "Engine"):** For financial structuring and sales to sophisticated investors, we will use efficient market mechanisms like **Dutch Auctions** for public funding tranches. This allows the market to perform price discovery, ensuring we secure capital at the lowest possible cost (i.e., the lowest acceptable ROI for investors), thus maximizing the funds left for the DIH treasury.

## 3. De-Risking Early Investment with Assurance Contracts

The primary risk for an early investor is the collective action problem: "What if not enough other people invest?" We eliminate this risk entirely using **Assurance Contracts**.

-   **Mechanism:** All initial funds will be deposited into a secure, transparent smart contract escrow. These funds are locked and cannot be accessed by the project team.
-   **The Guarantee:** The smart contract has a pre-defined funding goal (e.g., \$250 million) and a deadline (e.g., 12 months).
    -   If the goal **is met** by the deadline, the funds are released to the project treasury.
    -   If the goal **is not met**, the funds are automatically and trustlessly returned to every single investor.
-   **Net Benefit:** This "money-back guarantee" removes all fundraising risk for our backers, creating powerful social proof and encouraging faster, more confident commitments. We may also implement a **Dominant Assurance Contract (DAC)** model, where a patron offers a small bonus (e.g., extra governance tokens) to all participants if the goal is met, further incentivizing early support.

## 4. Phased Fundraising Model

Our fundraising will occur in stages, aligning with project milestones to progressively de-risk the investment.

1.  **Seed Round:** The initial tranche (\$250M–\$400M) will be raised from strategic partners with fixed, highly attractive terms, secured by the assurance contract.
2.  **Public Sales:** Subsequent tranches will be sold via public offerings (e.g., Dutch auctions), allowing the market to price the instruments based on the project's progress and reduced risk profile.

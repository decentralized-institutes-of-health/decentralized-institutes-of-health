# ðŸ“– Chapter 12: How You Can Join

This is not a spectator sport. The War on Disease requires a global coalition of citizens, investors, leaders, and builders. Your skills, your capital, and your voice are critical to this mission.

Here are the specific ways you can take action today.

---

### For Everyone: Join the 3.5%

The single most important action you can take is to join the **[Global Referendum](./strategy.md)**. Our first objective is to mobilize 3.5% of the world's population to create an undeniable mandate for change.

- **Vote "Yes":** Sign the 1% Treaty and make your voice heard.
- **Share the Mission:** Use your network to spread the word. Every person you recruit brings us closer to the tipping point.

### For Investors & Donors: Fund the Victory

This mission is powered by a new financial engine. You can help capitalize it.

- **Accredited Investors:** If you are an accredited investor interested in the pre-seed or seed rounds to fund the activation team, **[contact us](./operations.md)**.
- **Public Investors:** Once launched, you can purchase **[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.md)**. This is your opportunity to invest directly in the war on disease and earn a financial return based on the success of the 1% Treaty.
- **Philanthropists:** If you represent a foundation or are a major donor, your support can provide the critical first-loss capital to de-risk the project for other investors and accelerate our timeline.

### For Leaders of Non-Profits, NGOs, and Advocacy Organizations

Your organization can play a pivotal role in building the coalition, and the case for your involvement is not based on altruism, but on arithmetic.

- **The Challenge: Run the Numbers.** We ask you to do one thing: run a rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the impact of your current programs to the impact of redirecting a portion of your advocacy budget to helping pass the 1% Treaty. The data shows that for almost any major global problemâ€”health, poverty, climate, or human rightsâ€”helping to unlock the $16.5 trillion peace dividend is the single highest-leverage action you can take to achieve your own mission. When you are ready to join the coalition, **[contact us](./operations.md)**.

### For Builders & Technologists: Enlist Your Skills

We are recruiting the elite "activation team" to build the infrastructure for this global movement.

- **The Core Team:** We are hiring for key leadership roles in engineering, finance, growth, and political strategy. See our **[hiring plan](./operations.md)** for more details.
- **Contribute to Open Source:** The dFDA protocol and the global referendum engine will be open-source projects. We will be posting bounties for specific features and security audits.

This is a call to arms for the world's most talented and driven individuals. If you believe in the mission, we want you on the front lines.

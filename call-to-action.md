# ðŸ“– Chapter 12: How You Can Join

This is not a spectator sport. The War on Disease requires a global coalition of citizens, investors, leaders, and builders. Your skills, your capital, and your voice are critical to this mission.

Here are the specific ways you can take action today.

---

### For Everyone: Join the 3.5%

The single most important action you can take is to join the **[Global Referendum](./strategy.md)**. Our first objective is to mobilize 3.5% of the world's population to create an undeniable mandate for change.

-   **Vote "Yes":** Sign the 1% Treaty and make your voice heard.
-   **Share the Mission:** Use your network to spread the word. Every person you recruit brings us closer to the tipping point.

### For Investors & Donors: Fund the Victory

This mission is powered by a new financial engine. You can help capitalize it.

-   **Accredited Investors:** If you are an accredited investor interested in the pre-seed or seed rounds to fund the activation team, **[contact us](./operations.md)**.
-   **Public Investors:** Once launched, you can purchase **[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.md)**. This is your opportunity to invest directly in the war on disease and earn a financial return based on the success of the 1% Treaty.
-   **Philanthropists:** If you represent a foundation or are a major donor, your support can provide the critical first-loss capital to de-risk the project for other investors and accelerate our timeline.

### For Leaders of Organizations & Non-Profits: Form an Alliance

Your organization can play a pivotal role in building the coalition.

1.  **Run the Numbers:** We ask you to do one thing: run a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the impact of your current programs to the impact of helping pass the 1% Treaty. The data shows that redirecting a portion of your advocacy budget to this fight is the highest-leverage action you can take to achieve your own mission.
2.  **Join the Coalition:** Contact us to formally join the alliance of non-profits, advocacy groups, and research institutions fighting for this cause. Your voice lends critical legitimacy and expertise.
3.  **Become a Sponsoring Partner:** As the DIH launches its specialized sub-institutes, you can become a fiscal sponsor or governance partner for the institute aligned with your mission (e.g., The Decentralized Institute of Cancer Research).

### For Builders & Technologists: Enlist Your Skills

We are recruiting the elite "activation team" to build the infrastructure for this global movement.

-   **The Core Team:** We are hiring for key leadership roles in engineering, finance, growth, and political strategy. See our **[hiring plan](./operations.md)** for more details.
-   **Contribute to Open Source:** The dFDA platform and the global referendum engine will be open-source projects. We will be posting bounties for specific features and security audits.

This is a call to arms for the world's most talented and driven individuals. If you believe in the mission, we want you on the front lines.

# Pre-Seed Strategy: The First 90 Days

This document outlines the foundational "Phase 0" required to launch the War on Disease initiative. The high-level plans detailed in the [Canonical Roadmap](./roadmap.md) and [Fundraising & Budget Plan](../economic-models/fundraising-and-budget-plan.md) depend on the successful execution of this initial, targeted pre-seed phase.

The primary goal of this phase is to secure the necessary legal, financial, and human capital to build the infrastructure for the larger seed fundraising rounds and global referendum campaign.

## 1. Core Legal Structure

The operation will be managed through a dual-entity structure to separate for-profit execution from non-profit mission oversight, ensuring both legal compliance and mission integrity.

*   **For-Profit Management Company (SPV):**
  *   **Purpose:** The operational engine of the initiative. This entity raises venture capital, hires the core "activation team," manages strategy, develops technology, and executes the campaign.
  *   **Entity Type:** A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), likely a C-Corp or LLC, designed to generate returns for its investors upon the successful launch and capitalization of the DIH and VICTORY Bonds.
  *   **Accountability:** Accountable to its investors and board of directors. All initial hires will be employees of this entity.

*   **Non-Profit Foundation:**
  *   **Purpose:** The guardian of the mission. This entity ensures the project's activities remain aligned with its core goal of eradicating disease and promoting global health.
  *   **Entity Type:** A non-profit organization (e.g., a 501(c)(3) or equivalent).
  *   **Accountability:** Provides legal and ethical guardrails, serves as a potential recipient for philanthropic grants, and holds oversight powers to ensure the DIH operates as intended.

**First Action:** The immediate first step is the legal incorporation of these two entities.

## 2. Pre-Seed Fundraising

The initial fundraising target is a **$1M - $3M pre-seed round**.

*   **Recipient:** This capital will be raised by and for the **For-Profit Management Co.**
*   **Purpose:** This is *not* for funding the War on Disease directly. It is startup capital to fund the company that will *organize* the War on Disease.
*   **Use of Funds:**
  *   **Salaries:** Founder and core activation team for the first 12-18 months.
  *   **Legal & Compliance:** Retain top-tier legal counsel for securities, election law, and international treaty frameworks.
  *   **Operations:** Cover initial operating expenses, technology subscriptions, and establishment of a data room for the seed round.
  *   **Initial Platform Prototyping:** Fund the design and early architecture of the global referendum platform.

## 3. The Core "Activation Team"

The pre-seed funds will be used to hire a small, world-class team to build the foundation for the larger operation. These individuals will work for the **For-Profit Management Co.** The three immediate, critical hires are outlined in the [Hiring Plan](../careers/hiring-plan.md):

1.  **Capital Markets Lead:**
    *   **Mandate:** Structure the VICTORY bonds, build the comprehensive financial model and data room, and lead the subsequent seed and Series A fundraising efforts.

2.  **Elections & IE Compliance Lead:**
    *   **Mandate:** A legal and political expert responsible for designing the legally-compliant framework for the global referendum and the multi-jurisdictional independent expenditure (IE) strategy.

3.  **Growth & Referrals Lead:**
    *   **Mandate:** A product and growth leader responsible for designing the technology, incentive structure, and viral referral mechanics of the global referendum platform and VOTE points system.

This lean, expert team provides the necessary foundation to de-risk the project and successfully execute the larger fundraising and mobilization efforts outlined in the main roadmap.

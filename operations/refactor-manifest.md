title: "Refactor Manifest"
description: "A master list of all files and directories for the wiki refactoring. Curate this list to define the action for each item."

# Refactor Manifest

Curate this list by changing the action for each file or directory.
Valid actions are: **KEEP**, **MOVE**, **RENAME**, **DELETE**.

**Instructions:**
1.  Change `KEEP` to the desired action.
2.  For `MOVE`, provide the destination path after the source path (e.g., `MOVE ./old/path.md ./dFDA-protocol/new/path.md`).
3.  For `RENAME`, provide the new name after the old name (e.g., `RENAME ./old-name.md ./new-name.md`).
4.  Leave as `KEEP` for files that should not be touched.
5.  Change to `DELETE` for files that should be removed.

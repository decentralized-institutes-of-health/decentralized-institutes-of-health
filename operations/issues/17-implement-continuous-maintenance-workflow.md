**Objective:** Refactor the agent to follow a continuous, incremental maintenance workflow as defined in the `agent/README.md`.

**Key Development Tasks:**
1.  **Create New Tools:**
    -   `findNextFileToReview()`: Finds the next file where `lastModified > lastReviewed`.
    -   `updateReviewTimestamp(filePath)`: Adds/updates the `lastReviewed` date in a file's frontmatter.
2.  **Refactor Existing Tools:**
    -   Create `analyzeSingleFile(filePath)` by refactoring the logic from the old `repositoryAnalyzer` tool to operate on a single file.
    -   Delete the old `repositoryAnalyzer` tool and the `operations/repository-health-report.md` file, as they are now obsolete.
3.  **Update Agent's Core Logic:**
    -   Rewrite the `ExecutiveDirector`'s instructions in `agent/src/index.ts` to implement the new workflow loop.
    -   Integrate the new tools into the agent's toolset.

# Global Survey on Human Values

The current medical research system is slow and expensive. New treatments take an average of **17 years** to reach patients, and **95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment**. This survey is designed to measure public support for a global initiative to upgrade this system, making it faster, cheaper, and more effective. Your anonymous responses will help demonstrate public demand for reform worldwide.

## Section 1: Priorities and Funding

### Part 1: The 1% Treaty

The "1% Treaty" proposes that all signatory nations redirect 1% of their annual military budget to a global fund. Proponents argue that accelerating medical progress is a critical component of national and global security. This fund would subsidize patient participation in decentralized clinical trials, aiming to dramatically accelerate the development of new cures. ([Read the full security rationale here.](./national-security-argument.md))

**1. Do you support or oppose your country signing the 1% Treaty?**
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Oppose
- [ ] Unsure / Need more information

### Part 2: Core Funding Priorities

**2. Imagine you are given \$100 representing public funds. How would you allocate it between the following two areas?** (The total must add up to \$100).

- **Military / War:** \$______
- **A Decentralized Institutes of Health (to fund efficient medical trials):** \$______

## Section 2: Principles for Research Reform

The following questions are about the core principles of this initiative. The central proposal is to upgrade our medical research infrastructure with an **open-source, decentralized platform**, as outlined in the ["Right to Trial and FDA Upgrade Act"](../../act.md).

This "FDA.gov v2" platform would work like this:
1.  Any patient could see a ranked list of the most effective treatments for their condition, based on all available global data.
2.  Any patient would have the **right to participate** in a clinical trial from home.
3.  All trial data would be made public to accelerate new discoveries.

This new model is made possible by dramatic cost reductions. Evidence from successful, large-scale studies like the UK's [RECOVERY trial](../../reference/recovery-trial-case-study.md) shows this approach can cut per-patient trial costs by over **95%** (from ~$43,000 down to ~$500), enabling more research for more people.

**Q7: Support for the Principles**
Based on these goals, to what extent do you support or oppose creating a new system based on these principles?

**Q8: Personal Participation**
If you or a loved one had a serious condition, and a decentralized trial for a promising new treatment was available through a platform like the one described, how likely would you be to participate?
- Very Likely
- Somewhat Likely
- Unsure
- Somewhat Unlikely
- Very Unlikely

## Section 3: Wishocracy - Setting Public Priorities

This section uses a method called **"Wishocracy"** to understand your priorities. You will be shown a series of randomly chosen pairs of public spending areas. For each pair, please allocate **$100** between them based on what you believe is more important.

This helps illustrate how public priorities may differ from current government spending.

**Part A: Domestic Program Funding**

For each pair of U.S. federal programs, allocate $100 based on your priorities.

-   **List of Programs for Comparison:**
  -   Military / War
  -   Healthcare (e.g., NIH, CDC, Medicare/Medicaid)
  -   Scientific & Medical Research
  -   Education
  -   Infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, energy grid)
  -   Social Security & Retirement Benefits
  -   Environmental Protection
  -   Justice System & Law Enforcement
  -   International Aid & Diplomacy
  -   Direct Payments to Citizens (Universal Basic Income)

**Part B: Global Challenge Priorities**

Now, allocate $100 for each pair of major global challenges.

-   **List of Challenges for Comparison:**
  -   Curing Diseases (e.g., Cancer, Alzheimer's)
  -   Preventing Future Pandemics
  -   Combating Climate Change
  -   Reducing Global Poverty
  -   Promoting Peace & Preventing Conflict
  -   Advancing Scientific Discovery & Space Exploration
  -   Improving Global Education
  -   Protecting Biodiversity & Ecosystems

**Q9: Support for A System That Aligned Public Spending With Your Values**
Would you support the adoption of a system such as Wishocracy that allowed your values to influence the allocation of public resources in accordance with your priorities?
- Strongly Support
- Support
- Neutral
- Oppose
- Strongly Oppose

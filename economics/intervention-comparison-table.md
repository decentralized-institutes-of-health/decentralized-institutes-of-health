## Introduction

This article compares the dFDA platform to other historically high-ROI and high-QALY-per-dollar health interventions. The table below summarizes the best available data for each intervention, including return on investment (ROI), cost per QALY gained (ICER), and estimated QALYs gained per $1 million spent. This provides context for the scale and efficiency of dFDA relative to foundational public health measures.

_Note: The bar represents the mid-point of the uncertainty range, and the error bars indicate the lower and upper bounds of the estimate. For "Smallpox Eradication," the upper bound is illustrative of its high, open-ended impact._

**Key:**

- **ROI**: Return on investment; dollars saved or value created per $1 spent.
- **Cost per QALY Gained (ICER)**: Lower is better; "Dominant" means saves money and improves health. Values may be in USD ($) or GBP (£).
- **QALYs Gained per $1M**: Rough estimate, varies by context and population.

### Smallpox Eradication

> "Adding up, the benefit–cost ratio for the entire world would have been about (($350 + $1070) ÷ 0.03)/$298 ≈ 159 : 1. These are huge numbers." - [PMC3720047](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3720047/)

### Childhood Vaccination (US)

> "Economic analysis for 2009 alone found that each dollar invested in vaccines saved more than $10 in total societal costs" - [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6316a4.htm)

> "In a 2005 study on the economic impact of routine childhood immunization in the United States, researchers estimated that for every dollar spent, the vaccination program saved more than $5 in direct costs and approximately $11 in additional costs to society.” - [Vaxopedia](https://vaxopedia.org/2017/10/01/what-are-the-benefits-of-vaccines/)

### Clean Water & Sanitation (LMICs)

> "For every dollar invested in water and sanitation, there is a $4.3 return in the form of reduced health care costs for individuals and society around the world" - [UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/11/484032)

> "Universal access to clean water, toilets, and hygiene would boost the global economy by trillions of dollars over the next two decades... and would bring returns of 21 times their cost." - [WaterAid](https://www.wateraid.org/us/media/economic-report-unlock-trillions-of-dollars-with-clean-water-decent-toilets-and-hygiene)

### Tobacco Control (taxes, bans)

> "In our study of six Asia-Pacific countries, we found that for every unit of local currency invested in increasing tobacco taxes, the countries would gain between 20 and 1,057 units in return over 15 years. That's a remarkable return on investment ratio of between 20:1 and 1,057:1." - [UNDP](https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/blog/how-raising-tobacco-taxes-can-save-lives-and-cut-poverty-across-asia-pacific-0)

### Hypertension Screening & Treatment

> "The estimated cost per QALY gained for screening was less than $1000 for men and approximately $1600 for women." - [PMC5217841](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5217841/)

### Statins for High-Risk Patients

> "Standard statin was cost-effective across all categories with incremental cost per QALY from £280 to £8530, with higher intensity statin cost-effective at higher cardiovascular risks and higher LDL-C levels." - [The Lancet](<https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00053-X/fulltext>)

### Polypill for Primary Prevention (High-Risk)

> "A polypill strategy was potentially cost-effective compared to other strategies for most sub-groups ranging from dominance to up to £18,811 per QALY depending on patient sub-group." - [PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182625)

### Generic Drug Substitution

> "According to the IMS Health Institute, generic drugs saved the U.S. health care system $1.67 trillion from 2007 to 2016." - [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/generic-drugs/generic-drug-facts)

## Conclusion

The dFDA platform is projected to have a higher ROI and more QALYs per dollar than almost any other single health intervention, rivaled only by foundational public health measures like smallpox eradication and mass vaccination in low-resource settings. Most other interventions, while highly cost-effective, do not approach the systemic leverage or scale of dFDA.

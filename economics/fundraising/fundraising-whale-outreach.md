# Whale & Billionaire Outreach Strategy

## Objective

Raise $1-2.5B in 6-12 months by targeting 100-200 high-net-worth individuals and institutions who can write $10-100M checks, rather than trying to raise from thousands of smaller investors.

## Why This Approach

**Speed vs. Scale Trade-off:**
- **Traditional fundraising**: 6-18 months to reach thousands of investors
- **Whale targeting**: 1-6 months to reach 100 key decision makers
- **Check sizes**: $10-100M vs. $1-10K
- **Legal complexity**: Lower (fewer investors) vs. Higher (more investors)

**Unit Economics:**
- 1 meeting → $50M check vs. 50,000 meetings → $50M in small checks
- Higher success probability with mission-aligned billionaires than random retail

## Outreach Templates & Messaging

### Template 1: Crypto Whales (Governance Angle)

**Subject:** Invitation to govern $27B health treasury (Bitcoin-level impact)

**Body:**
"Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because of your work building [Specific Protocol/Company]. The governance mechanisms you've pioneered in [Protocol] demonstrate exactly the kind of thinking needed for our next project.

We're building the world's largest decentralized health treasury ($27B annually) using proven DAO models from MakerDAO/Uniswap. Early VICTORY bond holders will govern allocation of this treasury across global health research.

This isn't just an investment - it's a chance to direct more capital than the NIH budget toward curing diseases through 80X more efficient decentralized trials.

The round is $250-400M from 10-20 investors. Would you be open to a 30-minute briefing on the governance structure and treasury mechanics?

[Your name]
P.S. Full technical architecture available at [link]"

### Template 2: Health Billionaires (Industry Advantage)

**Subject:** 2-5X your R&D budget (backed by government treaties)

**Body:**
"Hi [Name],

Your work at [Company] demonstrates exactly why our current R&D system is broken. You're spending billions on trials that take 10+ years, while the Oxford RECOVERY trial showed we can do the same research at 80X lower cost.

We're redirecting 1% of global military spending ($27B annually) into health research using these efficient trial methods. Early investors get governance control over the allocation.

For [Company], this would mean 2-5X more R&D funding for the same work you're already doing, plus governance votes on priority areas.

The treaty has backing from [specific names] and follows the same model that created $7T in fossil fuel subsidies. This is how we create $27B in health subsidies.

First close is $250-400M. Are you available for a confidential briefing?

[Your name]"

### Template 3: Foundations (Mission Multiplication)

**Subject:** 10X your health impact without additional donations

**Body:**
"Hi [Name],

[Foundation] has invested $X billion in global health with incredible results. We have a proposal that could 10X that impact without requiring additional donations.

We're creating a treaty that redirects 1% of global military spending ($27B annually) into health research. Early funders get permanent governance control over allocation.

Your $50M investment would give [Foundation] voting control over $2.7B annually - 54X leverage on your committed capital, in perpetuity.

This uses the same proven model that created $7T in fossil fuel subsidies, but directed toward saving lives instead of environmental destruction.

The first governance round is $250-400M from mission-aligned institutions. Would you be open to a strategic briefing?

[Your name]"

- Experienced fundraising team with health/crypto networks
- Clear milestones with investor updates

### Competition Risk

- First-mover advantage in this specific approach

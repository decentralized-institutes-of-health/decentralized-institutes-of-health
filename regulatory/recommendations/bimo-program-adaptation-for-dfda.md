# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) Program Guidance (Compliance Program Guidance Manuals - CPGMs for Sponsor/Monitor/CRO, Clinical Investigator, IRB inspections)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA CPGMs (e.g., 7348.811, 7348.810, 7348.809) and related BIMO guidance/procedures.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

The BIMO program includes FDA's compliance program for inspecting sponsors, monitors, clinical investigators, contract research organizations (CROs), and IRBs involved in conducting clinical trials. The goal is to ensure the protection of human subjects, compliance with regulations (e.g., GCP, IND/IDE rules), and the integrity of data submitted to FDA.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While essential for trial oversight, the traditional BIMO inspection model faces challenges with modern decentralized trials (DCTs) and platforms:

* **Focus on On-Site Audits:** Historically emphasizes on-site inspection of investigator sites, sponsors, and IRBs to review physical records and processes.
* **Inefficiency for DCTs:** On-site inspections are resource-intensive and less efficient for DCTs where participants are remote, data is collected electronically via platforms, and oversight may be centralized.
* **Documentation Focus:** Inspections often focus heavily on reviewing extensive documentation (e.g., monitoring reports, source documents) which may be less relevant or generated differently in a platform-based trial.
* **Redundancy with Platform Audits:** Some BIMO objectives (e.g., verifying data integrity, monitoring oversight) could potentially be achieved more efficiently by auditing the validated systems and immutable data logs within a certified dFDA platform.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Oversight of clinical trial conduct is critical. The *methods* and *focus* of BIMO inspections need significant adaptation for platform-based DCTs.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, FDA BIMO guidance and CPGMs should be modified:

* **Revise BIMO Guidance for DCTs/Platforms:** Issue revised BIMO CPGMs and guidance specifically addressing inspection approaches for trials conducted on certified dFDA platforms.
* **Prioritize Remote/Platform Inspection:** Prioritize remote inspection techniques and direct auditing of the **platform's validated systems, immutable data logs, electronic source data, automated compliance checks, and sponsor/CRO oversight systems documented within the platform.**
* **Risk-Based Site Selection:** Focus resource-intensive physical site visits only on specific high-risk situations (e.g., complex procedures conducted locally, concerns about specific investigators) or for initial qualification/periodic verification, rather than routine sampling.
* **Repeal Guidance on Routine Site Audits:** Repeal guidance elements recommending routine, process-heavy physical site inspections for data points or processes that can be reliably verified through platform audits.
* **Leverage Third-Party Audits:** Integrate findings from accredited third-party audits of platforms or sponsors (linked to platform certification) into BIMO inspection planning and risk assessment.
* **Focus on Data Integrity & Subject Safety:** Ensure inspection focus remains squarely on verifying critical data integrity (especially for primary endpoints and safety data) and ensuring adequate subject safety oversight mechanisms within the platform/DCT context.

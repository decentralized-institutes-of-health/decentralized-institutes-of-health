# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Product Liability Frameworks (Federal & State Tort Law) - Need for Clarification via FDA/HHS Guidance or Safe Harbors

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Not a specific federal regulation/guidance, but relates to the application of existing tort law principles in the context of novel trial platforms and the need for potential federal guidance or regulatory safe harbors.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

Product liability law (primarily state tort law, influenced by some federal regulations and court decisions) is intended to provide recourse for individuals harmed by defective or unreasonably dangerous products, including medical products. It aims to compensate injured parties and incentivize manufacturers to produce safer products.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

The application of traditional product liability principles to highly automated, decentralized trial platforms like dFDA creates significant uncertainty:

* **Uncertainty of Liability Assignment:** It is unclear how liability would be assigned in cases of harm potentially related to the platform's operation (e.g., manufacturer vs. investigator vs. platform provider vs. AI algorithm vs. patient user error).
* **AI/Algorithm Liability:** Specific uncertainty exists regarding liability for harm potentially resulting from AI-driven insights, recommendations, or monitoring failures within the platform.
* **Impact of Patient Autonomy:** Increased patient autonomy and self-management in DCTs may complicate traditional duty-of-care and causation analyses.
* **Deters Innovation:** This legal uncertainty can deter investment and participation by sponsors, technology providers, investigators, and patients in innovative platform-based trial models due to fear of unpredictable or potentially ruinous litigation.
* **Direct-to-Patient Model Risks:** Direct-to-patient shipping and remote monitoring models introduce new logistical factors that could be subject to liability claims.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

Not applicable, as this primarily concerns state tort law principles. However, federal agencies (like FDA/HHS) could potentially issue guidance or create regulatory safe harbors to clarify expectations and reduce uncertainty for activities conducted under specific federal regulatory frameworks (like dFDA trials).

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Federal guidance/policy should be developed to address liability uncertainty:

* **Develop Clear Frameworks/Safe Harbors:** HHS/FDA could develop clear legal frameworks or regulatory safe harbors (via guidance or potentially rulemaking linked to platform certification) clarifying the expected distribution of liability among stakeholders (manufacturers, sponsors, investigators, platform providers, patients) specifically within the context of certified dFDA platform operations.
* **Address Algorithm Liability:** Guidance should specifically address liability considerations related to validated platform algorithms, data integrity, remote monitoring failures, and direct-to-patient models operating under the dFDA framework.
* **Explore No-Fault Compensation:** Explore the feasibility and potential structure of no-fault compensation systems (similar to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program) specifically for certain types of injuries occurring within the context of highly innovative platform-based trials, potentially funded through platform fees or other mechanisms.
* **Link to Platform Certification:** Tie safe harbor protections or clarified liability standards to adherence to robust platform certification standards, incentivizing best practices in platform design, security, and operation.

# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Device Classification & Pre-market Requirements (Modification of 21 CFR Parts 860-892 & related Guidance)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Relevant sections of 21 CFR Parts 860-892 (e.g., Part 860 - Classification; Part 807 - 510(k); Part 814 - PMA); Related FDA guidance documents.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations establish the framework for classifying medical devices based on risk (Class I, II, III) and define the corresponding pre-market submission requirements (e.g., 510(k) premarket notification for moderate-risk devices, Premarket Approval (PMA) for high-risk devices). The goal is to ensure that devices are reasonably safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While providing necessary oversight for risky devices, the existing pre-market requirements can be excessive and inefficient for certain lower-risk devices or software, especially when continuous real-world monitoring is feasible:

* **Pre-market Burden for Low-Risk:** Requiring extensive pre-market data submission (even 510(k)) can be overly burdensome and slow market entry for lower-risk devices (Class I/II) or SaMD, particularly if their real-world performance can be closely monitored.
* **Focus on Pre-Market Prediction:** The system heavily emphasizes predicting safety and effectiveness before marketing, potentially undervaluing the power of robust post-market surveillance, especially continuous monitoring via platforms like dFDA.
* **Stifles Iteration:** Pre-market requirements can slow down iterative development cycles common for software and digital health tools.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No, risk-based classification and pre-market review for high-risk devices are necessary. However, the requirements for lower-risk devices should be radically simplified or repealed *if* robust post-market monitoring via a certified platform is mandated.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance should be modified to create streamlined pathways contingent on platform use:

* **Create Exemptions/Simplified Pathways:** Modify device classification regulations (Part 860) or pre-market submission requirements (Parts 807, 814, related guidance) to create **exemptions from traditional pre-market review or radically simplified pathways (e.g., registration and mandatory platform integration only)** for low-risk devices/SaMD (potentially certain Class I and Class II types).
* **Contingent on dFDA Monitoring:** Make these exemptions/simplifications strictly **contingent upon the mandatory use, evaluation, and continuous, transparent safety and effectiveness monitoring of the device/SaMD via a certified dFDA platform.**
* **Shift Focus to Post-Market:** Explicitly shift the regulatory focus for these exempted/simplified pathway devices from pre-market prediction to robust, real-world performance data and post-market control facilitated by the dFDA platform.
* **Repeal Unnecessary Pre-Market Req's:** Effectively repeal the requirement for submitting extensive 510(k) or potentially even PMA data for specific low-risk device categories where mandated dFDA platform monitoring provides adequate assurance of safety and effectiveness.

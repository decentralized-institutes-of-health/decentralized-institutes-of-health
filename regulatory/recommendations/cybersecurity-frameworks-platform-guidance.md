# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### Last Name

### Email

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Cybersecurity Frameworks & Requirements (e.g., HIPAA Security Rule - 45 CFR 164 Subpart C, FDA Cybersecurity Guidances, NIST CSF applicability)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

45 CFR Part 164, Subpart C (HIPAA Security Rule); Various FDA Guidances on Cybersecurity for Medical Devices/Platforms; NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations, guidances, and frameworks establish standards and best practices for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) and ensuring the cybersecurity of medical devices and related software platforms. They aim to mitigate risks from cyber threats, prevent data breaches, and ensure the continued safe and effective operation of health technology.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While essential for security, applying existing frameworks to large-scale, global, decentralized platforms like dFDA raises specific challenges:

* **Scalability Concerns:** Ensuring adequate security across a potentially vast, decentralized network involving millions or billions of users, diverse data sources (wearables, apps, EHRs), and numerous stakeholders requires robust, scalable security architectures beyond traditional enterprise models.
* **Complexity of Decentralized Systems:** Managing security (access control, encryption, monitoring, incident response) in a highly decentralized ecosystem can be more complex than in centralized systems.
* **Need for Tailored Standards:** General frameworks like NIST CSF or even the HIPAA Security Rule may need specific interpretation or supplementation with standards tailored to the unique risks and architecture of large-scale health data platforms.
* **Incident Response Clarity:** Requires clear protocols for breach notification and coordinated response in a complex, multi-stakeholder decentralized environment.
* **Incentives for Security:** Lack of clear incentives (like safe harbors) for adopting best practices might hinder investment in optimal security measures.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Robust cybersecurity is non-negotiable for a platform handling sensitive health data. Existing rules provide a foundation, but specific guidance and potentially safe harbors are needed for the dFDA context.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, specific guidance should be developed, and interpretations clarified:

* **Platform-Specific Security Standards:** Develop specific cybersecurity standards and best practices via guidance, tailored to large-scale, decentralized health data platforms like dFDA, potentially referencing or building upon existing frameworks like NIST CSF and HIPAA.
* **Mandatory Audits/Certifications:** Require regular, independent security audits and potentially formal certifications (linked to platform certification) for the core dFDA platform and potentially major integrated data sources.
* **Decentralized Incident Response Protocols:** Establish clear protocols via guidance for cybersecurity incident reporting, investigation, notification (under HIPAA Breach Notification Rule), and coordinated response specifically designed for a decentralized, multi-stakeholder platform context.
* **Safe Harbors:** Issue guidance potentially offering safe harbors from certain penalties (e.g., under HIPAA) following a breach if predefined, certified best-practice security protocols were demonstrably implemented and followed, incentivizing robust security adoption.

# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Regulations/Guidance on AI/ML in Healthcare Decision-Making (e.g., FDA Action Plan on AI/ML-Based SaMD, related guidances)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents and Action Plans related to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Medical Devices/Software.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These guidances and frameworks aim to establish principles for the safe and effective development, validation, and lifecycle management of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms used in medical devices and software (SaMD). They address considerations like algorithmic transparency, bias assessment, management of continuous learning algorithms, and validation methodologies appropriate for AI/ML.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While providing a necessary starting point, the evolving nature of AI/ML and its application in complex platforms like dFDA creates ongoing regulatory challenges:

* **Validation Complexity:** Establishing clear, efficient validation pathways for complex AI/ML algorithms used for core dFDA functions (e.g., real-time safety signal detection, efficacy analysis/ranking, adaptive trial modifications, protocol generation) remains challenging.
* **Transparency vs. IP:** Balancing the need for algorithmic transparency (for validation and trust) with intellectual property protection for developers can be difficult.
* **Bias Assessment:** Robust methods for assessing and mitigating bias in algorithms trained on potentially biased real-world data require further development and standardization in guidance.
* **Continuous Learning:** Regulating algorithms that continuously learn and adapt based on incoming platform data presents unique challenges for validation and change control (addressed partly in SaMD change control item).
* **Lifecycle Management:** Clear expectations for ongoing performance monitoring, retraining, and lifecycle management of AI/ML components within the dFDA platform need refinement.
* **Human Oversight:** Defining appropriate standards and requirements for human oversight of critical AI-driven decisions made within the platform requires careful consideration.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Specific regulatory consideration for AI/ML in healthcare is essential. The frameworks need continuous development and refinement specific to platform applications.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, guidance should be continuously updated and made more specific:

* **Platform-Specific AI/ML Pathways:** Establish clearer regulatory pathways via guidance for the validation and ongoing monitoring of AI/ML algorithms used specifically within certified dFDA platforms.
* **Standardized Validation Approaches:** Define more standardized validation methodologies appropriate for different types of AI/ML applications within the platform (e.g., analytical validation, clinical validation using platform data).
* **Transparency Requirements:** Define specific requirements for algorithmic transparency balanced with IP protection, potentially using methods like publishing performance metrics, validation summaries, or using trusted third-party auditors.
* **Bias Assessment Standards:** Develop and incorporate clear standards and best practices via guidance for assessing and mitigating algorithmic bias in the context of dFDA platform data.
* **Continuous Learning Validation:** Refine guidance on validating and managing continuously learning algorithms within the platform's lifecycle management framework (linking with SaMD change control).
* **Human Oversight Standards:** Define clear standards via guidance for required levels and methods of human oversight for critical AI-driven decisions within the dFDA platform, based on risk.

# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### Last Name

### Email

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

21 CFR 312.32 - IND Safety Reporting

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR 312.32

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

This regulation requires sponsors of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) to promptly review and report certain adverse event information to the FDA and all participating investigators. The goal is to ensure timely awareness of potential serious risks associated with an investigational drug, allowing FDA and investigators to take appropriate action to protect human subjects.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While critical for safety oversight, the current implementation can be burdensome and less efficient in the context of modern platforms:

* **Complexity:** Definitions of what needs expedited reporting (e.g., seriousness, expectedness, causality assessment) can be complex and subject to interpretation, leading to over- or under-reporting.
* **Reporting Timelines/Volume:** Strict timelines (e.g., 7-day, 15-day reports) combined with high event volumes in large trials can create significant workload.
* **Lack of Harmonization:** Differences persist between FDA requirements and other global regulators.
* **Integration Challenges:** Traditional reporting processes are often manual and not well-integrated with automated data capture and analysis systems, leading to delays and potential transcription errors.
* **Duplication:** Reporting individual events separately can be less informative than analyzing aggregate data trends, which platforms can do in near real-time.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Timely safety reporting is fundamental. However, the *method* and *requirements* for submission should be modernized, and specific reporting requirements should be repealed if the platform provides continuous, equivalent oversight and direct FDA access.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, significantly modified to leverage platform capabilities:

* **Streamline Expedited Criteria:** Simplify and clarify the criteria for expedited reporting.
* **Aggregate Reporting:** Encourage or allow aggregate reporting for known/expected events, focusing expedited reports on truly unexpected serious events or significant safety signals.
* **Harmonization:** Continue efforts towards international harmonization of safety reporting requirements.
* **Mandate Automated Reporting:** Define standards and mechanisms via guidance for **automated safety reporting directly from certified/validated dFDA trial platforms to the FDA** (e.g., via API), meeting specific data format criteria.
* **AI-Based Signal Detection:** Develop guidelines via guidance for the validation and use of AI-based safety signal detection algorithms using platform data as part of the safety surveillance system.
* **Accept Platform Summaries:** Allow platform-generated aggregate safety summaries, meeting specific criteria, to fulfill certain reporting obligations.
* **Repeal Duplicative Submissions:** Repeal regulations mandating separate, manual submission of individual safety reports (e.g., Form FDA 3500A for INDs) when the same data is reliably captured, logged, and potentially flagged by, and directly accessible to FDA within, a certified dFDA platform.

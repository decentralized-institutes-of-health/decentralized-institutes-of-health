# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### Last Name

### Email

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Charging for Investigational Drugs (21 CFR 312.8)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR 312.8

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

This regulation generally prohibits the commercialization of an investigational drug but allows sponsors to charge for an investigational drug under specific circumstances, primarily to recover the direct costs of making the drug available (manufacturing, distribution, salaries directly related to providing the drug for the study, etc.) under an IND. The intent is to facilitate access to investigational drugs, particularly for treatments for serious diseases, without allowing premature commercialization or profiting from unapproved products.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While allowing for cost recovery is helpful, the strict prohibition on profit and the focus solely on direct cost recovery has significant impacts:

* **Limits Sustainable Funding:** Restricts potential funding models for trials, especially those initiated by investigators, non-profits, or smaller companies that might rely on charging to sustain operations beyond just direct costs.
* **Discourages Platform Trials:** May discourage sponsors from placing drugs on broad access platforms like dFDA if they cannot generate revenue beyond cost recovery to support wider participation or platform fees.
* **Reduced Market Incentives:** The inability to price based on value or potential benefit, even within the controlled context of a trial, reduces market-based incentives for developing and providing access to potentially valuable investigational therapies.
* **Ambiguity:** Defining and justifying "direct costs" can sometimes be ambiguous.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

The interpretation limiting charges strictly to cost recovery should be repealed. The underlying principle of controlling premature commercialization might remain, but the mechanism needs radical change to support innovative trial models and sustainable access.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, significantly modify the regulation or its interpretation via guidance:

* **Permit Market-Based Pricing/Profit:** Explicitly modify the regulation or its interpretation via guidance to **permit market-based pricing and profit potential** for investigational drugs made available through certified dFDA trials. Allow willing patients, third-party payers (including government programs like NIH under specific frameworks), and sponsors to negotiate prices freely.
* **Repeal Cost-Recovery Limitation:** Repeal the interpretation limiting charges strictly to cost-recovery for dFDA platform trials to allow market forces and value-based pricing to incentivize R&D, platform participation, and scaling access.
* **Transparency:** Ensure transparency in pricing models used within the platform context.
* **Clarify Permissible Charges:** Alternatively, significantly clarify and expand the definition of permissible charges under the existing cost-recovery framework to explicitly include overhead, platform operational costs, and reasonable margins necessary to sustain broad trial participation via dFDA platforms, facilitating sponsorship beyond traditional large pharmaceutical companies.

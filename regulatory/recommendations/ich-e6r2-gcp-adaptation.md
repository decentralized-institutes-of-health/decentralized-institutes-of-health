# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (FDA Adopted Guidance)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

FDA Guidance: E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1)

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

GCP guidelines are intended to provide a unified standard for the European Union, Japan, and the United States to facilitate the mutual acceptance of clinical data by the regulatory authorities in these jurisdictions. They aim to ensure that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While setting important ethical and quality standards, GCP guidelines, particularly as sometimes interpreted or implemented, lead to significant operational burdens and costs:

* **Extensive Documentation:** Requires vast amounts of documentation, much of which may not be critical for safety or primary endpoint integrity.
* **Source Data Verification (SDV):** Traditional emphasis on 100% or high-percentage SDV is extremely resource-intensive and may not be the most efficient way to ensure quality, especially with reliable eSource.
* **Monitoring Requirements:** Emphasis on frequent on-site monitoring adds significant cost and complexity, especially for large or decentralized trials.
* **Focus on Perfection:** Can lead to a focus on perfecting all data points, rather than focusing resources on critical data quality.
* **Applicability to Automation:** Some requirements are poorly suited to highly automated or decentralized settings where data capture and trial management are platform-driven.
* **Potential Bias:** Can implicitly favor traditional trial designs and processes over more innovative, flexible approaches.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. The core principles of ethical conduct and data credibility are essential. However, the specific implementation guidance and the interpretation of its requirements should be significantly adapted for modern, technology-enabled trials, and specific prescriptive requirements should be repealed when a platform provides equivalent assurance.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, the FDA's adoption and interpretation guidance should be modified, and potentially a simplified "dFDA-GCP" standard defined:

* **Define "dFDA-GCP":** Define via guidance a simplified standard tailored for certified dFDA platforms, leveraging platform capabilities.
* **Risk-Based Quality Management (RBQM):** Fully implement and clarify guidance on RBQM and monitoring, with specific adaptations for DCTs (e.g., robust central/remote monitoring standards, digital tool validation, eSource data integrity standards).
* **Repeal Manual SDV/Monitoring Requirements:** Repeal specific guidance interpretations or requirements demanding extensive manual SDV and frequent on-site monitoring when these functions are verifiably fulfilled by a certified dFDA platform's validated eSource capture, automated checks, and central monitoring capabilities.
* **Focus on Critical Data:** Focus QA/QC and monitoring efforts strictly on data critical to subject safety and primary endpoint integrity.
* **Repeal Non-Critical Documentation:** Repeal or significantly simplify requirements for non-critical documentation, especially for data automatically collected, secured (e.g., blockchain), and managed by a validated platform.
* **Clarify Automated Oversight:** Clarify oversight expectations when trial operations are highly automated via a platform.
* **Maximize Design Flexibility:** Issue guidance explicitly maximizing sponsor flexibility in choosing scientifically valid trial designs verifiable via the platform, repealing interpretations favoring traditional processes embedded within GCP.

# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Procedures & Guidance (related to Section 564 of FD&C Act; FDA EUA Guidances)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents on Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

Guidance related to EUAs describes the FDA's policies and procedures for facilitating the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products, during public health emergencies (e.g., pandemics, bioterrorism threats). It outlines the criteria for issuing an EUA and the types of evidence that might support such an authorization.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While crucial during emergencies, the EUA process relies on rapid evidence generation, which can be challenging and potentially accelerated by integrated platforms:

* **Evidence Generation Speed:** Generating sufficient evidence quickly to support an EUA decision during an unfolding emergency is a major challenge.
* **Real-Time Data Integration:** Current processes may not be optimally structured to rapidly integrate and evaluate real-time safety and effectiveness data emerging from large-scale platforms like dFDA.
* **Pre-Planning Limitations:** Mechanisms for pre-planning or pre-positioning data collection strategies via platforms for potential future emergencies could be strengthened.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. The EUA mechanism is a critical tool for public health emergencies. It should be enhanced by better integrating platform capabilities.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, relevant FDA guidance and potentially regulations should be modified:

* **Expedited Pathways for Platform Data:** Modify EUA guidance or related regulations (e.g., IND regulations) to create **explicit, expedited pathways for utilizing evidence generated from certified dFDA platforms** (including RWE) to support EUA submissions and decisions during public health emergencies.
* **Pre-Agreed Protocols/Standards:** Establish mechanisms via guidance for sponsors and FDA to develop **pre-agreed protocols or data standards for use on certified dFDA platforms** that could be rapidly activated during emergencies to generate EUA-supporting evidence.
* **Real-Time Data Review:** Develop processes outlined in guidance for the rapid review and consideration of real-time safety and effectiveness data streams generated via certified dFDA platforms during emergencies to inform EUA issuance and ongoing monitoring.
* **Platform Role in Post-Authorization:** Clarify in guidance the role of certified dFDA platforms in fulfilling post-authorization data collection requirements (e.g., safety monitoring, effectiveness studies) for products granted an EUA.

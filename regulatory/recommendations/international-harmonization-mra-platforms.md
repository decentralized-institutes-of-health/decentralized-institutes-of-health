# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

FDA International Cooperation Procedures & Guidance (related to Mutual Recognition Agreements - MRAs, Harmonization efforts)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA guidance documents, policies, and procedures implementing MRAs and other international cooperative arrangements.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These guidances, policies, and agreements aim to facilitate international cooperation between the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Goals include harmonizing technical requirements, allowing mutual recognition of inspections or certifications, sharing information, and reducing duplicative regulatory efforts to speed patient access to safe and effective medical products globally.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While progress has been made (e.g., GMP inspection MRAs), current international cooperation mechanisms often fall short in the context of rapidly evolving, global, platform-based research:

* **Slow Harmonization:** Harmonization of technical standards (e.g., data formats, platform validation requirements) across major regulatory regions often proceeds slowly.
* **Limited Scope of MRAs:** Existing MRAs may not explicitly cover novel areas like certification of complex digital trial platforms or validation of specific DCT components.
* **Duplicative Reviews Persist:** Lack of mutual recognition in key areas (like platform certification or acceptance of platform-generated data based on shared standards) means sponsors still face duplicative reviews and validation demands when running global trials on platforms like dFDA.
* **Impedes Global Trials:** These factors collectively slow down the initiation and conduct of seamless global trials and hinder the efficient pooling of global data generated via standardized platforms.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. International cooperation is vital. The procedures and scope of agreements need significant enhancement and focus on platform-based research.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, FDA procedures, guidance, and negotiation priorities for international agreements should be modified:

* **Explicit Pathways for Platform Recognition:** Modify FDA procedures and guidance related to international cooperation (e.g., under existing or new MRAs) to explicitly include pathways for the **mutual recognition of dFDA-like platform certifications** conducted by trusted foreign regulatory partners meeting agreed-upon standards.
* **Harmonize Platform Standards:** Prioritize international harmonization efforts (e.g., through ICH, ICMRA) specifically on technical standards for dFDA-like platforms, including data formats, security requirements, algorithm validation, and platform certification criteria.
* **Accept Harmonized Data:** Commit via policy/guidance to accepting clinical data generated via platforms certified under mutually recognized international standards without requiring extensive re-validation.
* **Repeal Duplicative Requirements:** Repeal FDA requirements or guidance interpretations demanding duplicative U.S.-specific reviews, validations, or inspections where a trusted international partner has already certified platform compliance based on mutually agreed, harmonized standards.

# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Data Standardization/Interoperability Mandates (e.g., ONC Cures Act Final Rule - 45 CFR Part 171, HIPAA standards - 45 CFR Part 162, related FDA guidance)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Example: 45 CFR Part 171 (ONC Cures Act Final Rule), 45 CFR Part 162 (HIPAA Admin Simplification); Related FDA guidances.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and guidances aim to improve the electronic exchange of health information by establishing technical standards, content standards (like USCDI), and requirements for interoperability (e.g., via standardized APIs like FHIR). The goal is to reduce information blocking, enhance patient access to their data, and facilitate better coordination of care and data use for research and public health.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While promoting interoperability is crucial, the current state and enforcement present challenges for platforms like dFDA:

* **Incomplete/Slow Adoption:** Universal adoption and effective implementation of deep interoperability standards (especially standardized APIs like FHIR) across all health IT systems (particularly EHRs) is slow and incomplete.
* **Enforcement Gaps:** Lack of strong enforcement mechanisms hinders the ability of platforms like dFDA to automatically and reliably aggregate necessary data from diverse external sources (EHRs, apps, wearables) in a standardized format.
* **Burdensome Certification:** Health IT certification requirements can be burdensome.
* **Potential Over-Specification:** Mandates could potentially become overly prescriptive regarding internal data formats beyond what is necessary for external interoperability, stifling innovation within platforms.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Mandates promoting data standardization and interoperability are essential for dFDA's success. However, they need strengthening, better enforcement, and careful scoping.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance should be strengthened and refined:

* **Mandate Specific Standards:** Mandate (with strong enforcement) adoption of specific technical standards (e.g., FHIR APIs at specified versions, USCDI content standards) across *all* relevant health IT systems (EHRs, health apps, devices) to ensure platforms like dFDA can reliably access and exchange data.
* **Requirements for Platform Participation:** Establish clear requirements via guidance for real-time data access and exchange capabilities as a prerequisite for data sources (like EHR vendors) to participate in certified dFDA platform trials or contribute RWD.
* **Focus on Essential Interoperability:** Ensure via guidance that FDA/HHS data standardization mandates focus *only* on essential external interoperability standards and core data elements needed for regulatory review or platform data exchange. Avoid dictating internal platform data structures.
* **Repeal Overly Specific Guidance:** Repeal any existing guidance interpretations that suggest overly specific internal data format requirements beyond those needed for interoperability.

# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Additional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations (21 CFR Part 50, Subpart D) & Related Pediatric Study Guidance

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 50, Subpart D; Related FDA guidance documents on pediatric clinical trials and ethics.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and guidances establish additional safeguards to protect the rights and welfare of children participating as subjects in clinical investigations. They cover requirements for parental permission, pediatric assent, IRB review considerations specific to risks and potential benefits for children, and categorization of research based on risk levels.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While providing essential protections, applying these safeguards in the context of decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) conducted via platforms like dFDA requires specific consideration and clarification:

* **Remote Assent/Permission:** Existing regulations/guidance may not adequately address the practicalities and validation requirements for obtaining legally effective parental permission and pediatric assent remotely using digital tools.
* **Risk/Benefit Assessment in DCTs:** Guidance may be needed on how IRBs should assess risks and benefits specific to pediatric participation in DCTs (e.g., risks associated with remote monitoring technologies vs. benefits of reduced travel burden).
* **Data Privacy for Minors:** Specific considerations for protecting the data privacy of minors within a large-scale digital platform context need clear guidance.
* **Remote Monitoring Safeguards:** Need for clarity on appropriate remote monitoring methods and safeguards tailored for pediatric populations in DCTs.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Enhanced protections for children in research are ethically mandated. The regulations and guidance need adaptation for the DCT/platform context.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations or, more likely, specific guidance should be modified/issued:

* **DCT-Specific Pediatric Guidance:** Modify existing pediatric guidance or issue new guidance to provide **specific standards and acceptable methods for implementing required safeguards** for pediatric participants enrolled via the dFDA platform.
* **Remote Assent/Permission Standards:** Define clear standards via guidance for validating and implementing digital tools for obtaining remote parental permission and pediatric assent, ensuring comprehension and voluntariness.
* **Risk/Benefit Assessment for Pediatric DCTs:** Provide guidance to IRBs on assessing risks and benefits specific to pediatric DCT participation (e.g., evaluating usability/burden of digital tools, ensuring adequate remote safety monitoring).
* **Data Privacy Measures:** Outline recommended data privacy and security measures tailored for protecting minors' data within the dFDA platform architecture.
* **Remote Monitoring Methods:** Clarify acceptable remote monitoring methods and frequency appropriate for different pediatric age groups and trial risk levels within a DCT/platform setting.

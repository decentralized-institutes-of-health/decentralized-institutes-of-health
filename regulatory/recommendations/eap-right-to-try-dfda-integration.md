# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Expanded Access Programs (EAP) / Compassionate Use (Regulations 21 CFR Part 312, Subpart I & related FDA Guidance / Right to Try Act Interpretations)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 312, Subpart I; Related FDA Guidance on Expanded Access; Interpretations related to the Right to Try Act.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

EAP regulations provide pathways for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases, who lack comparable or satisfactory therapy options, to access investigational drugs outside of clinical trials. The Right to Try Act provides a separate pathway for eligible patients to access certain investigational drugs directly from manufacturers without needing FDA authorization for the access itself (though the drug must still be under an active IND). The goal is to provide potential access for patients who cannot participate in trials.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While aiming to provide access, both pathways have limitations and create administrative work that could be streamlined via platforms:

* **Administrative Hurdles (EAP):** The traditional EAP process often involves significant administrative burden for physicians and sponsors (e.g., separate submissions, IRB review, FDA authorization for protocols).
* **Limited Use (Right to Try):** The Right to Try Act pathway has seen relatively limited use, potentially due to manufacturer reluctance or lack of clear processes.
* **Potential Redundancy with Platform Trials:** If a patient is eligible for EAP or Right to Try *and* could potentially enroll in an ongoing trial for the same drug via an accessible platform like dFDA, maintaining separate access request processes is inefficient and potentially delays access.
* **Data Loss:** Access provided outside of structured trials (especially via Right to Try) often results in lost opportunities to collect valuable safety and outcome data.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Access pathways outside standard trials are important safety nets. However, they should be seamlessly integrated with platform trial enrollment where possible, and the need for separate FDA review under EAP should be repealed when platform participation fulfills requirements.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, EAP regulations/guidance and interpretations of Right to Try should be modified:

* **Platform Participation as EAP Fulfillment:** Modify EAP regulations (21 CFR 312, Subpart I) or issue overriding guidance to **formally recognize enrollment and participation in a relevant, appropriately designed trial on a certified dFDA platform as fulfilling the criteria and documentation requirements for an EAP request** for that eligible patient and investigational product.
* **Repeal Separate EAP Review:** Where a patient meets EAP eligibility criteria and can access the drug via a certified dFDA platform trial, **repeal the requirement for separate FDA review/authorization of an EAP protocol** under Subpart I.
* **Integrate Right to Try:** Issue guidance interpreting regulations and the Right to Try Act to clarify that if a patient meets statutory Right to Try criteria *and* the drug is available within an accessible dFDA trial protocol, manufacturers fulfilling requests should facilitate enrollment via the platform to enable data collection and oversight, effectively merging the pathways in this scenario.
* **Streamline IRB Review:** Clarify or modify guidance regarding IRB review requirements for patients accessing drugs via the platform under these integrated EAP/Right to Try scenarios, potentially allowing the main trial protocol's IRB approval to suffice.

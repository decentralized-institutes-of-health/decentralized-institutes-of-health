# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Regulations/Guidance (e.g., FDA SaMD Guidance series, related aspects of 21 CFR Part 800s)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents (Software as a Medical Device series, Cybersecurity, etc.); Relevant sections of 21 CFR Parts 800-898 (Device Regulations)

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and guidances establish a framework for the regulation of Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), including software intended for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or mitigation of disease. They aim to ensure the safety and effectiveness of SaMD based on risk classification, covering aspects like clinical evaluation, validation, quality management systems, and cybersecurity. Specific guidance addresses the lifecycle management of AI/ML-based SaMD.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While necessary for ensuring SaMD safety and effectiveness, the current framework can be challenging to apply efficiently to complex, integrated platforms like dFDA and their internal components:

* **Classification Complexity:** Determining the appropriate regulatory classification and pathway for the dFDA platform itself, or its various AI/ML components (used for analysis, ranking, monitoring, protocol generation), can be complex.
* **Pre-market Burden:** Applying traditional device pre-market review frameworks (like 510(k) or PMA) to internal platform tools or algorithms can be slow, costly, and ill-suited, potentially requiring extensive standalone validation.
* **Algorithm Change Control Uncertainty:** There is significant uncertainty and potential regulatory burden regarding how to manage, validate, and report updates or changes to AI/ML algorithms used within a certified platform, potentially stifling continuous improvement.
* **Validation Focus:** Emphasis on pre-market validation may undervalue the potential for robust post-market surveillance and real-world performance data generated within the controlled platform environment.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Regulation of SaMD, especially high-risk components, is necessary. However, the framework needs specific adaptations for large-scale platforms and their integral components, with repeal of unsuitable pre-market or change control requirements where platform controls provide assurance.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, develop specific regulatory frameworks/guidance and modify existing ones:

* **Platform-Specific Framework:** Develop a specific regulatory framework via guidance for large-scale, multi-functional clinical trial platforms like dFDA, addressing the platform as a whole and its components.
* **Lighter-Touch Pathway for Integral SaMD:** Develop a lighter-touch regulatory pathway (via guidance/modified regulation) for SaMD components *integral* to a certified dFDA platform's function (e.g., internal analysis tools, monitoring algorithms). Emphasize algorithm transparency, robust post-market surveillance using platform data, and real-world performance metrics.
* **Repeal Extensive Pre-Market Validation:** Repeal requirements for extensive pre-market validation (e.g., large standalone clinical studies) for established types of algorithms operating within the controlled, monitored environment of a certified platform, relying more on post-market performance.
* **Risk-Based Algorithm Change Control:** Establish a clear, risk-based framework via guidance for managing, validating, and obtaining regulatory clearance (if necessary, based on risk) for changes/updates to algorithms within a certified platform. Differentiate requirements based on change significance.
* **Repeal Rigid Change Control:** Repeal the applicability of overly rigid change control regulations designed for static software to continuously learning or frequently updated algorithms within a validated platform lifecycle management process.
* **Tiered Validation:** Define validation requirements (including algorithmic transparency, bias assessment, continuous learning validation) for platform components using tiered approaches based on component risk and function.

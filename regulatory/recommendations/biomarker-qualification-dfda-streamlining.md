# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Biomarker Qualification Process (FDA Guidance on Biomarker Qualification, related aspects of 21 CFR 314.500s - Accelerated Approval)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents on Biomarker Qualification; Related regulations like 21 CFR 314 Subpart H (Accelerated Approval based on surrogate endpoints).

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

The biomarker qualification process and related guidances are intended to facilitate the development and regulatory acceptance of biomarkers (e.g., prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic, surrogate endpoints) for use in drug development. Qualification means FDA has determined the biomarker is well-supported for a specific context of use, potentially streamlining its use in future trials or supporting accelerated approval.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While aiming to facilitate biomarker use, the current qualification process is often seen as:

* **Lengthy and Resource-Intensive:** Qualifying a biomarker often requires extensive, dedicated efforts and data packages, separate from the primary drug development trials.
* **Siloed Process:** It is often treated as a distinct process rather than being fully integrated with the ongoing clinical trial data generation, particularly RWE generation.
* **Underutilizes Platform Data:** Does not fully leverage the potential for continuous, large-scale real-world data collection via platforms like dFDA to rapidly generate the evidence needed to validate and qualify biomarkers within their context of use.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. A process for evaluating and qualifying biomarkers is necessary. However, it should be deeply integrated with and streamlined by platform-based evidence generation.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, guidance and related regulations should be modified:

* **Streamlined Platform-Based Qualification:** Modify FDA guidance and relevant regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 314 Subpart H) to establish **streamlined pathways for qualifying biomarkers based primarily on robust Real-World Evidence (RWE) generated continuously *through* a certified dFDA platform.**
* **Integrate with Trial Process:** Allow biomarker validation and qualification efforts to be directly integrated into the data collection and analysis protocols of dFDA platform trials, rather than requiring separate, dedicated studies.
* **Accept Platform RWE:** Explicitly state in guidance that sufficient RWE from a certified platform demonstrating a biomarker's validity for a specific context of use can fulfill qualification requirements.
* **Repeal Separate Package Requirements:** Repeal requirements for separate, extensive biomarker qualification packages where sufficient validation data emerges directly and continuously from certified platform-based trials and monitoring.
* **Accelerated Qualification:** Enable faster qualification decisions based on compelling interim or ongoing data generated via the dFDA platform.

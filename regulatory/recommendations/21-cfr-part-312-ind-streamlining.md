# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### Last Name

### Email

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

21 CFR Part 312 - Investigational New Drug Application (IND)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 312

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

Part 312 is intended to ensure the safety and rights of human subjects during clinical investigations of new drugs and biologics, and to ensure the quality of the scientific evaluation of drugs is adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety. It establishes the requirements for IND submissions, including preclinical data, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information, and clinical protocols, before human testing can begin.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While aiming for safety, the current IND requirements often impose significant upfront burdens that can delay trial initiation and increase costs, particularly for well-characterized compounds, novel platform technologies, or adaptive trials. Key impacts include:

* **Complexity of CMC requirements:** Can be overly burdensome, especially for early phases, academic sponsors, or novel manufacturing methods (e.g., distributed manufacturing for DCTs).
* **Extensive Preclinical Data:** Standard requirements may not always be necessary or efficiently tailored for certain modalities or platform-based approaches.
* **Fixed 30-day Review Clock:** Can be inefficient and doesn't easily accommodate rolling reviews or rapid iteration cycles.
* **Data Submission Formats:** Lack of mandatory, standardized digital formats hinders automated submission and review.
* **Trial Design Limitations:** The structure can be perceived as favouring traditional, rigid trial designs over more flexible, adaptive approaches suitable for platforms like dFDA.
* **Bias Against Innovative Designs:** Interpretations can implicitly discourage novel trial designs even if scientifically valid.
* **Extensive Documentation:** Requirements often seem redundant when robust digital platforms provide verifiable, real-time data.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. The core purpose of ensuring basic preclinical safety and manufacturing quality before human exposure is essential. However, specific requirements within Part 312 should be repealed or significantly modified where they create unnecessary burden or are made redundant by advanced platform capabilities.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, significantly modified, particularly for trials conducted on certified dFDA platforms:

* **Create a Streamlined IND Pathway:** For trials on certified dFDA platforms, radically reduce the IND submission to only essential preclinical safety data, manufacturing quality information, and the core protocol, relying heavily on platform monitoring for ongoing safety and compliance.
* **Repeal Redundant Documentation:** Repeal requirements for extensive upfront documentation (e.g., detailed monitoring plans, certain CMC sections) where platform capabilities provide equivalent or superior assurance.
* **Phased/Flexible Requirements:** Implement phased/streamlined CMC requirements based on development stage and platform knowledge. Allow flexible preclinical requirements for certain modalities.
* **Accelerated/Rolling Reviews:** Explore accelerated/rolling reviews post-Phase 1, especially for trials utilizing certified platform infrastructure.
* **Mandate Digital Formats:** Establish and mandate standardized digital data formats for automated submission and AI-assisted review via the platform.
* **Support Adaptive Trials:** Create specific regulatory pathways within Part 312 for platform-based adaptive trials (e.g., master protocols, basket trials).
* **Clarify DCT Requirements:** Clarify CMC requirements for novel/distributed manufacturing or direct-to-patient shipping models common in DCTs.
* **Support Automated Protocol Review:** Issue guidance supporting the validation and use of AI/ML tools for automated protocol checking/validation prior to submission.
* **Maximize Design Flexibility:** Issue guidance explicitly maximizing sponsor flexibility in choosing scientifically valid trial designs (adaptive, pragmatic, N-of-1, platform trials, etc.) verifiable via the platform, repealing interpretations favoring traditional designs.

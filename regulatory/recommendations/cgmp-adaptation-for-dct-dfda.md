# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) (Regulations like 21 CFR Parts 210, 211, 820 and related Guidance like G-CGMP-Phase1)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Regulations: 21 CFR Parts 210, 211 (Drugs), 820 (Devices). Guidance: e.g., "CGMP for Phase 1 Investigational Drugs"

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

cGMP regulations and guidances are designed to ensure that medical products (drugs, biologics, devices) are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards appropriate for their intended use. They aim to minimize the risks involved in pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product, ensuring product identity, strength, quality, and purity.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While essential for product quality and patient safety, cGMP requirements can be particularly challenging and costly in certain contexts relevant to dFDA:

* **Cost/Complexity:** Can impose significant costs and complexities, especially for novel modalities (e.g., cell/gene therapies), small/academic sponsors, or products manufactured in small batches for specific trials.
* **Early-Phase Stringency:** The stringency applied even in early phases (e.g., Phase 1 guidance) can be burdensome.
* **DCT Logistics Applicability:** Traditional GMP may not adequately address the specific logistical challenges of decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), such as packaging, labeling, and direct-to-patient shipping.
* **Rigidity:** Prescriptive requirements can be overly rigid and may not be suitable for adaptive or decentralized manufacturing processes potentially enabled by or used with dFDA platforms.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Ensuring product quality through manufacturing controls is critical. However, the regulations and guidance should be adapted to be more risk-based, flexible, and suitable for modern development and distribution models, with repeal of specific prescriptive elements where quality can be assured differently.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and associated guidance should be modified:

* **Phased/Risk-Based GMP:** Further develop/clarify phased GMP requirements appropriate for the development stage (e.g., Phase 1 vs. Phase 3) and specific risks of the product/platform.
* **Platform Manufacturing Certifications:** Explore certifications for specific manufacturing platforms or technologies that meet defined quality standards.
* **Guidance for Academic/Small Sponsors:** Provide specific guidance and support for academic manufacturing facilities or small sponsors facing GMP hurdles.
* **DCT Logistics Guidance:** Develop clear guidance on GMP requirements specifically addressing packaging, labeling, temperature control, and chain of custody for direct-to-patient shipping in DCTs.
* **Decentralized/POC Manufacturing:** Establish standards via guidance for validating decentralized or point-of-care (POC) manufacturing models if relevant to dFDA platform use cases (e.g., for personalized therapies).
* **Flexibility for dFDA Context:** Develop risk-based, flexible GMP guidance specifically for products manufactured for use within dFDA trials. Focus on quality/safety relevant to the trial context, allowing adaptive processes tied to the platform.
* **Repeal Unsuitable Requirements:** Repeal specific prescriptive GMP requirements identified as unsuitable or unnecessarily burdensome for decentralized/platform-based manufacturing where core quality principles are verifiably met via alternative validated methods (e.g., leveraging platform data for process validation or release).

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Regulatory Silos Across FDA Centers (Impacting review processes, data standards, and guidance consistency across CDER, CBER, CDRH, CFSAN)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Not a single regulation, but reflects inconsistencies in regulations (e.g., different data standards in 21 CFR Parts 312/314 vs. 812/814) and guidance documents issued by different FDA Centers.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

Each FDA Center (e.g., Center for Drug Evaluation and Research - CDER, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research - CBER, Center for Devices and Radiological Health - CDRH, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition - CFSAN) develops regulations and guidance tailored to the specific types of products they oversee, reflecting unique scientific and regulatory considerations for drugs, biologics, devices, foods, etc.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While allowing for specialized expertise, the siloed nature of FDA Centers creates significant challenges for unified platforms like dFDA that aim to evaluate diverse interventions:

* **Inconsistent Pathways:** Different regulatory pathways, data standards (e.g., SDTM/ADaM for drugs vs. device standards), evidence requirements, and review processes across Centers hinder a unified approach to evaluating interventions on a single platform.
* **Combination Product Challenges:** Creates complexity for reviewing combination products or interventions that span multiple categories (e.g., drug-device, digital therapeutic + drug, medical food + drug).
* **Platform Implementation Hurdles:** Makes it difficult to implement a single dFDA platform that can seamlessly handle submission, review, and monitoring for all intervention types according to different Center-specific (and sometimes conflicting) requirements.
* **Inefficiency:** Prevents direct comparison and ranking of diverse interventions (e.g., a drug vs. a device vs. a dietary change for the same condition) based on unified evidence generated via the platform.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

Not applicable directly, as it refers to organizational structure and resulting regulatory inconsistencies rather than a single rule. The *inconsistent regulations and guidances* resulting from these silos should be modified or superseded by harmonized ones for platform-based evaluations.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance across Centers should be harmonized specifically for platform-based evaluations:

* **Harmonize Standards for Platforms:** Issue cross-center guidance or modify relevant regulations to **harmonize data submission standards, clinical evidence requirements, and safety monitoring processes across Centers specifically for interventions evaluated on certified dFDA platforms.**
* **Integrated Review Pathways:** Create integrated review pathways or dedicated cross-center teams within FDA to handle submissions for products/interventions evaluated via the dFDA platform, regardless of product type or combination status.
* **Unified Evidence Standard:** Establish a unified standard of evidence quality and format generated by the dFDA platform that is acceptable across all relevant Centers, allowing for consistent evaluation and comparison of diverse interventions.

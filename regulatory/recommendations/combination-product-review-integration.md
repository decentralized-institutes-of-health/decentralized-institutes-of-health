# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Combination Product Review Framework (21 CFR Part 3 - Product Jurisdiction, 21 CFR Part 4 - Regulation of Combination Products, related guidance)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 3, 21 CFR Part 4; Related FDA guidances on combination products.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and associated guidances establish the framework for determining which FDA Center has primary jurisdiction for regulating a combination product (e.g., drug-device, biologic-device) and how the review process should be coordinated between centers. The goal is to ensure consistent and appropriate regulation for products composed of multiple component types.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While providing a structure, the current framework can create complexity and delays, particularly hindering efficient evaluation on a unified platform like dFDA:

* **Complex Jurisdiction Assignment:** Determining the primary mode of action and assigning the lead review Center can sometimes be complex and time-consuming.
* **Coordination Challenges:** Coordinating reviews, data requests, and timelines between different Centers (e.g., CDER and CDRH) can add significant delays and administrative burden.
* **Sequential Reviews:** Often leads to separate or sequential reviews of different components, rather than a holistic assessment.
* **Hinders Platform Integration:** Makes it difficult for a unified platform like dFDA to seamlessly handle the submission and integrated review of combination products evaluated using a single data stream.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. A framework for handling combination products is needed. However, the process needs significant streamlining for products evaluated via integrated platforms.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance should be modified specifically for the dFDA context:

* **Integrated Platform Review Pathway:** Modify regulations (Parts 3, 4) or issue overriding guidance to create **integrated, streamlined review pathways specifically for combination products developed and evaluated *using* a certified dFDA platform.**
* **Leverage Unified Data:** Explicitly allow the unified data stream from the dFDA platform to serve as the primary evidence base for a single, coordinated assessment of the combination product as a whole.
* **Dedicated Review Teams:** Consider establishing dedicated, cross-functional dFDA review teams with expertise from relevant Centers to handle platform-based combination product submissions.
* **Repeal Sequential Review Requirements:** Repeal regulations or guidance interpretations mandating separate or sequential reviews of components where the certified platform provides sufficient integrated evidence for a holistic assessment.

# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Instrument Validation (FDA PRO Guidance Documents)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents on Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (e.g., "Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims")

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

Guidance on PROs aims to advise sponsors on how to develop and validate instruments (questionnaires, diaries, etc.) that measure treatment benefit or risk directly from the patient's perspective without interpretation by a clinician or anyone else. The goal is to ensure these instruments are fit-for-purpose, reliable, valid, and capable of supporting labeling claims.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While promoting the important use of patient perspectives, the validation process outlined in guidance can be:

* **Time-Consuming and Costly:** Developing and validating PRO instruments, especially electronic versions (ePROs), according to current guidance often requires significant time and resources, including specific validation studies.
* **Burdensome for ePROs:** Applying traditional validation psychometric approaches to ePRO tools fully integrated within a digital platform can sometimes feel duplicative or ill-suited.
* **Slows Adoption:** The validation burden may slow the adoption of novel or platform-integrated PRO measures in clinical trials.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Ensuring PRO instruments are valid and reliable is crucial. However, the validation pathways should be streamlined for tools integrated within certified platforms.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, FDA guidance should be modified:

* **Streamlined Validation for Platform ePROs:** Modify FDA PRO guidance to establish **streamlined validation requirements specifically for ePRO tools that are fully integrated and standardized within a certified dFDA platform.**
* **Leverage Platform Data:** Explicitly allow platform-generated data on usability, patient engagement, data completeness, and real-world performance metrics (e.g., correlation with other outcomes) to serve as key components of the ePRO validation package.
* **Reduce Standalone Studies:** Reduce the need for extensive standalone psychometric validation studies for ePROs deployed within a validated platform infrastructure.
* **Repeal Unsuitable Guidance:** Repeal guidance interpretations demanding specific validation approaches (e.g., those developed for paper PROs) that are ill-suited or unnecessarily burdensome for validated, integrated platform ePRO tools.

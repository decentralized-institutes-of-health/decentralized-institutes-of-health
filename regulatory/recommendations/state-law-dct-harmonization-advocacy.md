# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

State Laws & Regulations (Telehealth, Pharmacy Practice, Professional Licensing) - Impact on FDA Guidance/Policy

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Not a specific federal regulation, but addresses the impact of varying state laws on the ability to conduct DCTs and the need for FDA/HHS policy/guidance to address this.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

State laws govern the practice of medicine, pharmacy, and other health professions within their borders. This includes setting standards for telehealth practice, requirements for pharmacy dispensing (including out-of-state prescriptions), and professional licensing requirements for healthcare providers (HCPs) treating patients within the state.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

The patchwork of inconsistent state laws creates significant barriers to conducting seamless nationwide or global decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) using platforms like dFDA:

* **Telehealth Restrictions:** Varying state laws on establishing patient relationships via telehealth, permitted modalities, and cross-state practice impede remote consultations and trial visits.
* **Pharmacy/Dispensing Laws:** Differences in state pharmacy laws regarding out-of-state prescriptions and direct-to-patient shipment of investigational products create logistical nightmares.
* **Licensing Barriers:** State-specific licensing requirements often prevent investigators or other trial HCPs from providing care or oversight to participants located in other states, hindering centralized or remote trial management.
* **Impedes National DCTs:** Makes it extremely difficult and costly to run truly national DCTs where participants can enroll and receive care/products regardless of their state location.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

Not applicable, as these are state laws. However, federal (HHS/FDA) policy and guidance should strongly advocate for solutions to mitigate the negative impact of these state-level inconsistencies on national research objectives.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Federal policy/guidance should be developed or modified to address state law barriers:

* **Advocate for Preemption/Compacts:** HHS/FDA should actively advocate for federal preemption (where authority exists) or promote interstate compacts to harmonize state laws specifically relevant to conducting registered clinical trials (telehealth practice standards, pharmacy dispensing for trials, cross-state licensing portability for trial investigators/staff).
* **Establish National Standards (via Guidance):** Issue federal guidance outlining recommended national standards for telehealth practice, remote prescribing, and cross-state licensing portability *specifically for the purpose of facilitating participation in registered, multi-state clinical trials* conducted via certified platforms like dFDA.
* **Collaborate with State Boards:** Engage proactively with state medical boards, pharmacy boards, and licensing bodies to develop model language or policies that facilitate DCTs while upholding state oversight responsibilities.

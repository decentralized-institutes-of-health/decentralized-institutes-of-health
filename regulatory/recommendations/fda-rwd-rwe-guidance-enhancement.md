# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

FDA Guidances on Real-World Data/Evidence (RWD/RWE) (e.g., "Real-World Data: Assessing Electronic Health Records and Medical Claims Data To Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products", "Real-World Evidence Program Framework")

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents (e.g., G-RWDRWE-Reg, G-RWDRWE-Doc)

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These guidances are intended to clarify the FDA's thinking on the use of real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) in regulatory decision-making. They aim to describe potential approaches for using RWD/RWE to support decisions regarding the effectiveness and safety of medical products, acknowledging the potential value of data collected outside traditional clinical trials.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While encouraging the use of RWD/RWE, current guidances are often perceived as lacking sufficient clarity and creating uncertainty for sponsors:

* **Lack of Definitive Standards:** Guidances often describe considerations rather than providing definitive standards for required data quality, provenance, study designs, and analytical methodologies for RWE to be considered adequate for regulatory decisions.
* **Sponsor Uncertainty:** This lack of concrete standards creates uncertainty for sponsors regarding the acceptability of RWE submissions, potentially discouraging investment in RWE-based approaches.
* **Integration with Platforms:** Guidance may not fully address the unique potential and challenges of generating high-quality, regulatory-grade RWD prospectively and continuously through certified digital platforms like dFDA.
* **Cautious Tone:** The overall tone can be perceived as overly cautious, particularly regarding the use of RWE for demonstrating effectiveness (as opposed to safety), limiting its potential to replace or supplement traditional RCTs.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Guidance clarifying the use of RWD/RWE is needed. However, it should be significantly strengthened, made more permissive, and specifically tailored to leverage the capabilities of certified dFDA platforms.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, existing guidances should be modified and potentially new, more definitive guidances issued:

* **Provide Concrete Standards:** Issue clearer, more concrete guidance and standards for RWD/RWE submissions, particularly regarding data quality, validation, study design, and analysis.
* **Platform-Specific Standards:** Specifically define standards via guidance for the **quality, provenance, validation, and analysis of RWD collected via certified digital platforms** like dFDA.
* **Clear Pathways for RWE Use:** Develop clear regulatory pathways outlined in guidance for using platform-generated RWE for key regulatory decisions (e.g., demonstrating effectiveness for label expansion, serving as external control arms, fulfilling post-market requirements).
* **Permissive Stance:** Adopt a more permissive stance, explicitly stating in guidance that high-quality RWE generated through validated dFDA platforms **can be considered primary evidence** for regulatory decision-making, reducing the need for separate, costly traditional RCTs where perpetual monitoring provides robust data.
* **Repeal Hindering Interpretations:** Repeal guidance interpretations that hinder the use of robust platform-generated RWE as equivalent to traditional trial data where scientifically appropriate.
* **Prospective RWE Agreements:** Enable and encourage prospective RWE study design agreements (similar to SPA for traditional trials) for studies utilizing certified platforms.
* **Support Reimbursement Decisions:** Explicitly state in guidance that high-quality dFDA platform-generated RWE should be considered suitable evidence for informing healthcare payer and HTA decisions.

# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### Last Name

### Email

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

21 CFR Part 56 & 45 CFR Part 46 (Common Rule) - Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 56 (FDA) & 45 CFR Part 46 (HHS Common Rule)

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations are intended to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research. They establish the requirements for the composition, operation, review procedures, and responsibilities of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) that review and approve research protocols before initiation and conduct continuing review.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While crucial for ethical oversight, the current IRB review system, even with the single IRB mandate, often creates bottlenecks and administrative burdens, especially for modern trial designs:

* **Burden of Multiple Reviews (Historically):** Although improving, ensuring consistent single IRB use across all sites can still face practical hurdles.
* **Variability:** Different IRBs may have varying requirements, interpretations, and review timelines, leading to inconsistencies.
* **Review Timelines:** IRB review can significantly delay study startup and amendment implementation, particularly for complex or multi-site/decentralized trials.
* **Suitability for Automation:** Traditional review processes are not always well-adapted for fully remote/automated trial models facilitated by digital platforms.
* **Bottlenecks:** Committee-based review can be inherently slow, especially for the rapid iterations possible in adaptive platform trials.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Independent ethical review is a cornerstone of human subject protection. However, the procedural aspects and reliance on traditional committee structures can be significantly modernized and streamlined, with some procedural requirements potentially repealed if oversight goals are met differently.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, modified to leverage technology and reduce unnecessary procedural delays:

* **Strengthen Single IRB Mandate:** Continue to strengthen and enforce the single IRB mandate for *all* multi-site/decentralized trials.
* **Promote Standardization:** Promote further standardization of IRB submission requirements and review criteria.
* **Remote/Platform-Based Review Standards:** Establish clear standards and acceptance criteria via guidance for remote IRB review processes facilitated by digital platforms.
* **AI-Assisted Review:** Develop frameworks via guidance for validating and utilizing AI-assisted IRB review for protocol safety/consistency checks.
* **Streamlined Pathways:** Implement streamlined review pathways for low-risk platform-based trials or amendments.
* **Alternative Oversight Models:** Authorize alternative, technology-augmented ethical oversight models via guidance (e.g., automated risk assessment for low-risk protocols, expert systems aiding review) to reduce reliance on committee bottlenecks while maintaining core ethical principles.
* **Repeal Incompatible Procedures:** Repeal specific procedural requirements (e.g., related to meeting formats, document handling) that hinder efficient, platform-integrated oversight where the core ethical review function is preserved.

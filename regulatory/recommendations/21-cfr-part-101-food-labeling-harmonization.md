# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Food Labeling and Claims Regulations (21 CFR Part 101 & related regulations/guidance for foods/supplements)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 101; Related regulations/guidance under CFSAN jurisdiction.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations govern the labeling of foods and dietary supplements, including nutrition information (Nutrition Facts panel) and permissible types of claims (e.g., health claims, nutrient content claims, structure/function claims). They aim to provide consumers with accurate information about the content and potential health effects of foods and supplements to help them make informed dietary choices.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

The separate regulatory framework for food/supplement labeling and claims creates issues for a unified dFDA platform:

* **Different Evidence Standards:** Foods and supplements (especially under DSHEA) are subject to different, often lower, standards of evidence for making health-related claims compared to drugs.
* **Incompatibility with Unified Ranking:** This disparity makes it impossible to evaluate and rank the effectiveness of foods, supplements, and drugs side-by-side using a consistent evidence standard within the dFDA platform.
* **Consumer Confusion:** Different claim types and standards can confuse consumers about the relative benefits and scientific backing of different interventions.
* **Hinders Comparative Effectiveness:** Prevents the dFDA platform from easily generating comparative effectiveness data across different intervention types (dietary vs. pharmaceutical) for specific health outcomes.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

The separate, lower evidence standards for food/supplement claims (especially structure/function claims allowed under DSHEA) should be repealed *for products evaluated on the dFDA platform*. Basic nutrition labeling requirements might remain, but health-related claims should be harmonized.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance should be modified to harmonize evidence standards within the dFDA context:

* **Harmonize Evidence Standards:** Modify relevant regulations (like 21 CFR 101) or issue overriding guidance to **require the same standards of evidence for health/efficacy claims across foods, supplements, and drugs *when evaluated via the certified dFDA platform*.**
* **Allow Unified Evaluation/Ranking:** Enable food/nutrient interventions and supplements to be evaluated and ranked alongside drugs based on platform-generated evidence using consistent scientific criteria.
* **Standardized Communication:** Permit communication of these unified findings (e.g., effectiveness rankings, probabilistic outcomes) in a standardized format for all intervention types evaluated on the platform, potentially through modification of labeling or advertising regulations.
* **Repeal Lower Standards (for Platform Use):** Effectively repeal the applicability of lower evidence standards (like those for DSHEA structure/function claims) for any food or supplement making health-related claims based on data generated or evaluated through the dFDA platform.

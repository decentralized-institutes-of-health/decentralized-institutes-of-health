### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Formal Dispute Resolution Processes (e.g., FDA Guidance "Formal Dispute Resolution: Sponsor Appeals Above the Division Level"; related MAPPs)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents and MAPPs related to formal dispute resolution and appeals.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These guidances and procedures establish formal processes for sponsors or applicants to appeal or seek reconsideration of specific FDA regulatory decisions or scientific disagreements that could not be resolved at the review division level. The goal is to provide a structured, fair, and transparent pathway for resolving disputes.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While providing an essential appeals mechanism, the current formal dispute resolution processes may be ill-suited for disagreements arising from dynamic, platform-generated data:

* **Geared Towards Static Submissions:** Processes are largely designed around disputes concerning static data packages submitted at discrete time points (e.g., an NDA/BLA/PMA submission).
* **Handling Dynamic Data:** It's unclear how current processes would efficiently handle disputes related to regulatory decisions based on dynamic, continuously generated, and potentially rapidly changing evidence from a dFDA platform.
* **Timeliness:** Formal appeal processes can be lengthy, which is problematic when dealing with decisions based on real-time data feeds.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. A formal mechanism for resolving disputes is necessary. It needs adaptation for platform-based evidence.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, relevant FDA guidance and MAPPs should be modified:

* **Establish Processes for Dynamic Data:** Modify guidance (MAPPs) to establish clear, potentially expedited processes specifically for handling scientific disputes or appeals related to regulatory decisions based primarily on dynamic data generated via certified dFDA platforms.
* **Platform-Based Re-analysis/Verification:** Incorporate mechanisms allowing for agreed-upon re-analysis windows using platform data or leveraging platform tools for independent verification as part of the dispute resolution process.
* **Adapt Timelines:** Consider adapting timelines and procedures for disputes involving real-time data to ensure timely resolution.
* **Repeal Incompatible Procedures:** Repeal specific procedural requirements within the dispute resolution framework that are incompatible with or inefficient for resolving issues related to continuous data generation and analysis.

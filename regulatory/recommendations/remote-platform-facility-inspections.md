# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

FDA Inspection Practices and Guidance (e.g., Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) Program Manual, GMP Inspection Guidance, Quality System Inspection Technique - QSIT)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents, Compliance Program Guidance Manuals (CPGMs), and internal procedures (MAPPs) related to facility inspections (BIMO, GMP, QSR).

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These guidances and procedures outline FDA's approach to conducting inspections of clinical trial sites (BIMO), manufacturing facilities (GMP), and device manufacturers (QSIT). The goal is to verify compliance with applicable regulations (e.g., GCP, GMP, QSR), ensure data integrity, confirm subject protection, and assess overall quality management systems.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While essential for oversight, traditional inspection practices face challenges in the context of decentralized trials and digitally integrated facilities:

* **Emphasis on On-Site Presence:** Traditional inspection models heavily emphasize physical, on-site presence to review records, processes, and facilities.
* **Inefficiency for DCTs/Platforms:** On-site inspection models are inefficient or less relevant for highly decentralized trials where data is captured electronically and managed centrally, or for manufacturing facilities heavily reliant on digital quality systems and process analytical technology (PAT) integrated with platforms.
* **Resource Intensive:** On-site inspections consume significant FDA and site/facility resources (travel, time, personnel).
* **Focus on Process over Data:** Can sometimes focus heavily on documented processes rather than directly auditing the integrity of digital data streams verifiable within a platform.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. The need for regulatory inspection and oversight remains. However, the *methods* of inspection should be significantly adapted to leverage remote techniques and platform-based data auditing.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, FDA inspection guidance and procedures should be modified:

* **Explicitly Allow Remote/Platform Audits:** Develop and modify guidance (e.g., BIMO Manual, GMP inspection guides, QSIT) to explicitly allow and prioritize **remote inspection techniques and platform-based audits** as a primary method for routine surveillance of clinical sites and manufacturing facilities participating in or integrated with certified dFDA platforms.
* **Focus on Digital Evidence:** Shift inspection focus towards auditing digital quality system records, electronic source data, process data streams, security logs, and audit trails directly within the certified dFDA platform.
* **Reserve On-Site for Cause:** Reserve resource-intensive on-site inspections primarily for initial qualification, for-cause investigations based on specific concerns, or periodic verification audits, rather than routine surveillance.
* **Repeal Guidance Mandating Physical Inspections:** Repeal internal policies or guidance interpretations that mandate routine physical site inspections where remote or platform-based methods can provide equivalent or superior assurance of compliance and data integrity.
* **Third-Party Audits:** Integrate findings from accredited third-party audits (linked to platform certification) into FDA's risk-based inspection planning.

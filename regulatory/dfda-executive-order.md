**TRANSFORMING THE FDA INTO A DECENTRALIZED, PATIENT-CENTRIC PLATFORM TO ACCELERATE MEDICAL INNOVATION AND EXPAND ACCESS TO SAFE, EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS**  

*It is hereby ordered as follows:*  

---

### **Section 1. Purpose**

The [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/) must transition from a centralized, gatekeeping model to a [**decentralized global autonomous algorithmic FDA (dFDA)**](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/conducting-clinical-trials-decentralized-elements). This transformation will:

- **Eliminate artificial barriers** between patients and treatments that have demonstrated basic safety.
- **Reduce costs** by automating clinical research, leveraging [decentralized trials](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/cder-conversations/evolving-role-decentralized-clinical-trials-and-digital-health-technologies), and aggregating global real-world data.
- **Empower patients** with personalized, quantitative assessments of all available interventions.
- **Accelerate medical progress by 80X** through automation and decentralization of clinical trials.

---

### **Section 1A. The Problem**

The current medical research system is failing billions of patients worldwide:

- **2 billion people** suffer from **thousands of diseases**, yet **95% lack FDA-approved treatments**.
- Despite **$60B/year in research funding**, clinical trials remain **slow, expensive, and scarce**.
- **NIH RECOVER ($1.6B) and All of Us ($4B) completed 0 trials** over multiple years.
- **60% of patients** are willing to join trials, yet **less than 5% are ever offered the chance**.
- No **global database** exists to rank treatment effectiveness using clinical and real-world evidence.

Additional critical issues include:

- **Excessive Costs**: [$41,000 per participant](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/getting-a-handle-on-clinical-trial-costs-0001) in traditional clinical trials
- **Deadly Delays**: [21,000 to 120,000 preventable deaths](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1985/5/cj5n1-10.pdf) each decade due to regulatory inefficiency
- **Innovation Bottleneck**: [166 billion](https://www.nature.com/articles/549445a) potential treatments remain untested
- **Time to Treatment**: [17 years](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/) average delay from discovery until patient access
- **Limited Progress**: It has been [44 years](https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox) since we last cured a disease
- **Data Gaps**: Negative results are rarely published, leading to repeated failed trials
- **Lack of Long-Term Data**: Most trials only track short-term outcomes
- **Unrepresentative Studies**: Up to [85% of patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985) are excluded from traditional trials

---

### **Section 2. Definitions**

(a) **"Decentralized Autonomous FDA (dFDA)"**: A blockchain-secured, AI-driven platform that continuously analyzes anonymized [real-world data (RWD)](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/science-and-research-special-topics/real-world-evidence) from global clinical trials, electronic health records, and patient-reported outcomes to rank treatments by safety and efficacy.
(b) **"Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs)"**: [Trials conducted via telemedicine, wearable sensors, and direct-to-patient supply chains, with no physical trial sites.](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/cder-conversations/evolving-role-decentralized-clinical-trials-and-digital-health-technologies)
(c) **"N-of-1 analysis"**: [A personalized assessment of an individual's response to a treatment, calculated by comparing their baseline health data to post-intervention outcomes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_of_1_trial)

---

### **Section 3. Policy**

#### **3.1 Establishment of the Decentralized Autonomous FDA**

Within 180 days, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall:
(a) Develop and deploy the **dFDA platform**, integrating:

- [Blockchain technology](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/blockchain/) for immutable, transparent data sharing (e.g., [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/projects/fabric)).
- **Open Source**: The dFDA platform will be developed as open-source software, with publicly accessible code repositories to foster transparency, community contributions, and independent audits.
- [Machine-learning models](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/machine-learning-models) trained on the entire universe of clinical and RWD, including international datasets ([EU EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/homepage), [Japan PMDA](https://www.pmda.go.jp/english/)).
- Automated adverse-event detection using [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) of social media, EHRs, and pharmacy records.
- **Transform fda.gov into an "Amazon for Decentralized Trials"** where anyone can effortlessly create or join a study, modeled after successful platforms like the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/).
- Implement **standardized, automated protocols** to reduce setup time and costs.
- Create a system where patients enter their condition and receive a **ranked list of the most effective treatments** based on comprehensive clinical and real-world data.
- Provide every patient with a personal [FDAi AI agent](https://fdai.earth) that can call them to collect data about food and drug intake, analyze time-series data using causal inference, and create n-of-1 studies to be aggregated in the global database.

Key Platform Features:

1. **Digital Twin Safe**: Secure storage and control of personal health data
2. **Automated Data Collection**: Integration with wearables and health apps
3. **Real-Time Analysis**: Continuous monitoring and pattern identification
4. **Outcome Labels**: Standardized treatment effect reporting
5. **Study Creation Tools**: Enable anyone to launch and manage clinical trials
6. **Global Data Integration**: Aggregate and analyze worldwide treatment outcomes

Cost Reduction Targets:

| Cost Category | Current Cost | Target Cost | Savings |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Data Management | $198,014 | $10,000 | 94.9% |
| IRB Approvals | $324,081 | $5,000 | 98.5% |
| Patient Recruitment | $805,785 | $15,000 | 98.1% |
| Clinical Procedures | $5,937,819 | $1,000,000 | 83.2% |
| Administrative | $7,229,968 | $100,000 | 98.6% |
| Total Trial Cost | $56,988,007 | $2,025,000 | 95.7% |

(b) Partner with the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) to ensure algorithmic fairness, reproducibility, and compliance with [CFR Title 21](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21).
(c) Collaborate with the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/) to adopt global data-sharing standards (e.g., [HL7 FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/)).

#### **3.2 Patient Access to Decentralized Clinical Trials**

(a) **Right to Trial**: Patients may participate in DCTs for any treatment that has completed Phase I safety testing, at their own expense if necessary.

- Providers and trial sponsors may not be held liable for off-label use in DCTs (pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 396).
- [AI-Powered IRB](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/cder-offices-and-divisions/institutional-review-boards-irbs-and-protection-human-subjects-clinical-trials) To expedite and enhance the safety review process, a safety-validated fine-tuned large language model (LLM) will act as the primary IRB for DCT protocols and approve all DCT protocols if they meet basic safety criteria (per [45 CFR § 46.109](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46/subpart-A/section-46.109)).
(b) **Streamlined Study Creation**: Drug manufacturers or researchers will have access to a simple online platform to propose and create studies, akin to a third-party vendor registration process on e-commerce platforms.
- **Direct Intervention Delivery**: Upon a new participant joining a trial, the primary responsibility of the study creator will be the prompt and efficient delivery of the intervention directly to the participant, their pharmacy, or healthcare provider.
(c) **Crowdfunding and Direct Payments**: Patients may crowdfund or directly pay for experimental treatments without triggering FDA "marketing" restrictions ([21 CFR § 312.7](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-312)).
(d) **Cost-Effective Trial Model**: Based on the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) which tested **18 treatments for just $3M**—about **$500 per subject, 80x cheaper than traditional trials**—by integrating into **EHRs** and using **simple online data entry**. With adequate funding, this model could test **hundreds of thousands of treatments**, dramatically accelerating drug discovery.

#### **3.3 Elimination of Economic Barriers**

(a) **Abolish Pharma User Fees**: The FDA shall cease collection of [Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)](https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/prescription-drug-user-fee-amendments) and [Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA)](https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/generic-drug-user-fee-amendments) fees as these are ultimately passed on to the patient in the form of higher costs for medicines. Funding gaps shall be offset by:

- Reallocating 50% of savings from automated trial oversight to FDA operations.
- Grants from the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) for high-priority public health tools (e.g., antibiotics, Alzheimer's drugs).

#### **3.4 Real-World Data Sharing Mandate**  

(a) **Open Outcomes Platform**: The FDA shall create a secure portal for patients and providers to upload de-identified "before and after" health data (e.g., lab results, wearable device metrics, symptom diaries) for all food, drug, and supplement use.  

- Data contributors retain ownership and may revoke access at any time ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) compliance required).
- The dFDA shall analyze this data in real time to update treatment rankings.
- **Global, real-time data sharing** will empower patients, researchers, and policymakers with unprecedented access to outcomes information.
(b) **N-of-1 Analysis**: For every patient, the dFDA shall automatically generate:
- A personalized dashboard showing their response to interventions (e.g., "Drug X reduced your migraine frequency by 42%").  
- Aggregated N-of-1 results to calculate population-level effect sizes (e.g., "Drug X works for 68% of female patients aged 30–50").  

#### **3.5 Quantitative Treatment Rankings**  

(a) **Dynamic Safety/Efficacy Scores**: The dFDA shall publish continuously updated rankings of all treatments for every condition, including:

- Off-label uses (e.g., "[Metformin for longevity](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-metformin-a-wonder-drug-202109222605)").
- Alternative therapies (e.g., "[Medical cannabis for chronic pain](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9999073/)").
- Comparative effectiveness vs. current standards of care (e.g., "Drug Y is 1.3x more effective than Drug Z but costs 8x more").
(b) **Outcome Labels**: Replace static drug labels with concise, data-driven summaries:  
- "Positive effects: 23% reduction in mortality (95% CI: 19–27%).  
- Negative effects: 8% risk of severe nausea (95% CI: 6–10%).  
- Probability of success for your profile: 72%."  

---

### **Section 4. Implementation**

(a) The HHS Secretary shall establish a **dFDA Task Force** with representatives from NIH, CDC, [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/), and patient advocacy groups (e.g., [PatientsLikeMe](https://www.patientslikeme.com/), [OpenTrials](https://opentrials.net/index.html)).
(b) Within 365 days, the FDA shall:

- Sunset all legacy review processes for DCTs and RWD-based approvals.
- Launch a public API for third-party developers to build dFDA-compliant apps.
(c) The [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://www.ftc.gov/) shall enforce penalties against entities that withhold or manipulate treatment outcome data ([15 U.S.C. § 45](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45)).
(d) **FDA X-Prize Program**:
- **Launch an FDA X-Prize** to fund the development of components for the **decentralized, automated clinical trial platform**.
- Allocate $100 million in prizes for breakthrough innovations in decentralized trial automation, patient recruitment, and real-world data integration.
- Prizes have proven effective where bureaucratic procurement has failed, creating competitive incentives for rapid innovation.
- The open-source model will allow anyone—individuals, organizations, or governments—to improve and integrate with the platform, overcoming the stagnation typical of closed-source projects.

(e) **Platform Development Milestones**:

1. **Patient Interface**:
   - Condition input system
   - Treatment ranking display
   - Trial enrollment portal
   - Automated outcome reporting
2. **Provider Tools**:
   - EHR integration

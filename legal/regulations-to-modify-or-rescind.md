- **Leverage dFDA for Record Retention Requirements (ICH E6 / 21 CFR Part 11 / GMP Regs Guidance):**
  - _Area for Review:_ Costly/duplicative maintenance of separate long-term archives.
  - _Potential Modifications:_ Issue guidance clarifying that validated dFDA platform's immutable electronic records fulfill primary retention requirements. Repeal guidance interpretations requiring separate, redundant sponsor-maintained archives for data captured reliably by the platform.

- **Cybersecurity Incident Response & Safe Harbors for Platforms (Modification of FDA Cybersecurity Guidance, HIPAA Security Rule 45 CFR 164 Subpart C):**
  - _Area for Review:_ Clarity needed on handling breaches in large-scale platforms; incentives for robust security.
  - _Potential Modifications:_ **Issue guidance clarifying cybersecurity incident reporting requirements specifically for certified dFDA platforms.** Potentially offer **safe harbors from certain penalties** if predefined, certified best-practice security protocols were implemented and followed, encouraging robust security adoption. Define clear protocols for breach notification/response in a decentralized context.

- **Recognize Patient Data Ownership & Facilitate Third-Party Ratings (HIPAA 45 CFR Parts 160, 164 Guidance):**
  - _Area for Review:_ Lack of explicit patient data ownership; barriers to market-based rating systems; restrictions on secondary use.
  - _Potential Modifications:_ Issue guidance interpreting HIPAA to maximize patient control, portability, and **explicitly recognizing individual ownership of raw health data**. Explicitly state regulations **do not prohibit** and should **facilitate** architectures enabling granular patient permissions (including for **broad secondary research via opt-out models**) and the creation of third-party rating systems using anonymized/aggregated dFDA data. Repeal interpretations hindering data flow for these purposes.

# Community Governance Framework

## Core Principle

**Voting Power = Token Holdings + Contribution Weight**

Authority should be earned through demonstrated contribution, not just purchased through tokens.

---

## Authority Levels

| Level           | Requirements                            | Permissions                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Observer**    | Any token holder                        | View proposals, participate in discussions          |
| **Contributor** | 10+ verified contributions              | Vote on routine proposals                           |
| **Core Team**   | 100+ contributions + community approval | Vote on all proposals, official spokesperson rights |
| **Leadership**  | 500+ contributions + supermajority vote | Strategic direction, partnership approvals          |

---

## Contribution Types & Weights

| Contribution Type    | Weight | Examples                             |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Code/Development** | 3x     | GitHub commits, platform development |
| **Research/Content** | 2x     | Wiki articles, technical papers      |
| **Fundraising**      | 2x     | Investor connections, grants         |
| **Community Growth** | 1.5x   | Referendum votes, partnerships       |
| **Operations**       | 1x     | Admin tasks, coordination            |
| **Token Holdings**   | 0.5x   | Financial investment only            |

## Simple Rules

### 1. Decision Making

- **Routine decisions**: Contributor+ vote required
- **Major decisions**: Core Team+ vote required
- **Strategic direction**: Leadership vote required
- **All votes**: Publicly recorded and transparent

### 2. Spokesperson Rights & Anti-Misrepresentation

**Who can represent officially**: Core Team members only

**What this means**:

- Give interviews/presentations on behalf of the project
- Make official statements to media or partners
- Represent the project at conferences/events
- Sign partnership agreements (with Leadership approval)

**Requirements**:

- Must understand mission and pass knowledge verification
- Disclose all conflicts of interest publicly
- Complete media training (for major public appearances)
- Use pre-approved talking points for sensitive topics

**What you CANNOT do**:

- Claim credit for others' work
- Make unauthorized commitments or promises
- Give medical advice or make health claims
- Represent personal opinions as official positions

**Quality control**: Community can revoke rights for poor representation

**Official Statement Requirements:**

- Must be posted on official channels first
- Include "This represents the official position of [Organization]" disclaimer
- Link to governance vote that authorized the position
- 48-hour community review for major announcements

**Personal Opinion Disclaimer Required:**
All members must use: "The views expressed are my own and do not represent [Organization]"

### 3. Conflict Management

- **Disclosure**: All financial interests must be public
- **Resolution**: Community vote for disputes
- **Penalties**: Loss of authority for undisclosed conflicts

### 4. Community Health & Protection

**New contributors**:

- Mentorship and clear contribution paths
- Education on spokesperson policies and disclaimers
- Gradual authority increases based on demonstrated reliability

**Quality standards**:

- Work must add value to mission
- All public statements reviewed for accuracy
- Zero tolerance for false medical/health claims

**Bad actors & violations**:

- **First violation**: Public warning + education
- **Second violation**: Loss of contributor status for 90 days
- **Third violation**: Permanent ban from spokesperson eligibility
- **Severe cases** (financial fraud, safety violations): Immediate expulsion + legal action
- **Community vote required**: For all authority removal decisions

**Reporting & Response**:

- Public #report-violations channel for transparency
- Anonymous reporting form for sensitive cases
- 24-hour response commitment for urgent misrepresentation
- Community bounty rewards for identifying impersonators

**Rapid Response Protocol**:

1. **Immediate**: Post official disclaimer on all channels
2. **Within 24 hours**: Contact individual directly
3. **If needed**: Public clarification with correct information
4. **Follow-up**: Community vote on appropriate sanctions

### 5. Verification & Platform Controls

**Official Spokesperson Registry**:

- Public list of authorized speakers on website
- Include photos, credentials, and authorization scope
- Real-time updates when status changes
- Official verification badges for public appearances

**Platform-Specific Rules**:

- **Social Media**: Only Core Team+ can have "member of [Org]" in bios
- **Events**: Speaker authorization form required before any presentation
- **Media**: Pre-approved talking points for interviews
- **Content**: Official presentation templates mandatory

**Identity Protection**:

- Regular monitoring for impersonation accounts
- Automated alerts for unauthorized use of logos/branding
- Priority SEO to ensure official content ranks first
- Partnership with fact-checking organizations when needed

**Template Responses for Unauthorized Representation**:
_"We are aware of statements made by [Name]. These do not represent our official position. Our only authorized spokespersons are listed at [link]. Official positions require community governance approval."_

## Special Considerations for Health DAOs

**Medical Claims**: Extra strict rules for health/medical statements - only verified medical professionals can make clinical claims

**Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure spokespeople understand FDA/EMA restrictions on health claims

**Patient Safety**: Zero tolerance for unauthorized medical advice or treatment recommendations

**Scientific Accuracy**: Fact-checking requirements for all research claims and statistical statements

**Crisis Management**: 24/7 response capability for health-related misinformation that could harm patients

---

**This framework grows with the community - start simple, add complexity only when necessary.**

_For a \$27B health DAO, reputation protection isn't just about brand management - it's about maintaining trust essential for saving lives._

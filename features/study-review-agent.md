# Study Review Agent

## Plausibility Review

- Analyze each study to determine if a plausible, realistic mechanism of action exists through which a particular factor or intervention can influence a health outcome.
- Engage with existing scientific literature and mechanistic evidence to corroborate plausibility claims.

## Data Validation and Quality Assessment

- Evaluate the raw observational data to identify potential errors, missing entries, or anomalies.
- Ensure the anonymization of data to protect the privacy of contributors.
- Exclude invalid data points or periods with significant data gaps.
- Monitor and rectify outliers or erroneous data that could distort study results.

## Temporality Analysis

- Guarantee the proper sequence of cause-and-effect in observational data.
- Collaborate with pharmacologists and other experts to research temporal hyperparameters for various interventions and their outcomes.
- Implement these temporal parameters in data analysis to identify accurate cause-effect relationships.

## Consistency Review

- Regularly engage with external health studies and datasets.
- Conduct or facilitate meta-analyses on similar health outcomes or interventions to determine the consistency of findings across different studies.
- Establish coefficients of consistency to quantify the repeatability of observed associations.

## Specificity Analysis

- Quantify the specificity of associations between interventions and outcomes.
- Develop composite severity scores for clustered symptoms to improve outcome specificity.
- Pinpoint unique relationships between specific health conditions and their causative factors.

## Biological Gradient Assessment

- Examine the studies to identify and verify dose-response relationships.
- Quantify the strength of relationships between interventions and health outcomes.

## Coherence Evaluation

- Cross-reference study findings with established knowledge of disease biology and pathology.
- Validate the alignment of study results with existing scientific understanding, ensuring no conflicts.

## Experimentation Compilation

- Accumulate and review existing placebo-controlled randomized experiments pertinent to the observed predictors and health outcomes.
- Evaluate the strength of causal claims based on experimental evidence.

## Safety Validation with LLM IRB

- Implement a safety-validated fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to act as an Institutional Review Board (IRB).
- Utilize the LLM IRB to evaluate study protocols for safety before proceeding with further review.
- The LLM IRB will assess protocols based on established safety guidelines and ethical considerations.
- Protocols will be submitted to the LLM IRB, which will provide a safety assessment, indicating whether the protocol is deemed safe or unsafe, and highlighting any potential safety concerns.
- This safety validation step will be integrated into the beginning of the study review process to ensure that all studies are evaluated for safety before undergoing other forms of review.

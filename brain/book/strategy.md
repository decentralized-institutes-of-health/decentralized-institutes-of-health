# ðŸ“– Chapter 7: Strategy - How to Bribe Literally Everyone

Our strategy is not to win a moral argument. It is to bribe the shit out of literally everyone.

We will succeed by offering everyone a deal that's better than what they have now. When supporting the 1% Treaty makes you more money than opposing it, rational people support it.

## How Politics Actually Works

Politicians don't do things because they're moral. They do things because they get paid. Here's what we know about how this works:

- **People are greedy.** Politicians, corporate leaders, and voters choose whatever makes them richer or more powerful. Our strategy relies on this, not on people being good.

- **Small groups beat big groups.** A small group getting a lot of money will always fight harder than a big group losing a little money. We give the small groups massive benefits for supporting the treaty.

- **Politics is shopping.** Policy isn't decided by who has the best moral argument. It's decided by who offers the best deal. We're offering a better deal.

- **Everyone wants a cut.** Lobbyists and corporations will always try to grab money through politics. Instead of fighting this, we redirect it. We've created a new, more profitable way for them to get rich: the Peace Dividend.

We're not hoping people change. We're giving them better incentives.

## The Bribe Sequence: How We Pay Everyone Off

The strategy unfolds in a sequence of bribes, each one funding the next, creating an unstoppable coalition of self-interest.

### 1. The Bribe for Rich People

- **Who:** Wealthy people, investment funds, and the military-industrial complex.
- **The Bribe:** Better returns than the best hedge funds, plus you get to vote on how a $27 billion budget gets spent.
- **40% Annual Returns:** **[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.md)** are designed to beat the world's best hedge funds.
- **You Get to Vote:** Investors don't just get money back. They get to control how a $27 billion annual budget gets spent. That's power.
- **Money-Back Guarantee:** If we don't raise enough money to make this work, you get a full refund.
- **The Result:** Defense contractors and billionaires make more money supporting peace than supporting war. So they support peace.

### 2. The Bribe for Regular People

- **Who:** Everyone else (targeting 280 million people worldwide).
- **The Bribe:** You help us get people to vote, you get paid when we win.
- **VOTE Points:** Every person who votes in our **[Global Referendum](./strategy/global-referendum/)** gets points. These aren't fake internet points. They represent real money.
- **You Get Paid:** After the treaty passes, those points become real ownership in the $27 billion annual health budget. You helped create it, you get a piece of it.
- **The Result:** Instead of a traditional protest where people wave signs and go home, we create 280 million people who have skin in the game. When 3.5% of the world's population wants something and will get paid for it, politicians listen.

### 3. The Bribe for Politicians

- **Who:** Presidents, prime ministers, and key legislators.
- **The Bribe:** We make them look good, help them win elections, and let them hand out money to their friends.
- **Popular Support:** We give them 280 million people demanding the treaty. Politicians love being on the popular side of an issue, especially when it costs them nothing.
- **Money for Their Districts:** Leaders who sign get to direct billions in R&D spending to universities and companies in their areas. They get to cut ribbons and take credit for bringing jobs home.
- **Their Rich Friends Get Richer:** The wealthiest people in their country get early access to the best investment returns in the world, but only if their leader signs the treaty. Rich people then pressure the leader to sign.
- **The Result:** Leaders who support the treaty get popular support, money for their districts, and happy rich friends. Leaders who oppose it get voted out by people who want their money. Easy choice.

## The Plan

Here's how we do it:

1.  **Months 0-3:** Set up the legal structure and hire smart people to run the campaign.
2.  **Months 4-36:** Launch the global referendum to get 280 million people to vote, and raise **[$1.2â€“$2.5 billion](./economics/fundraising-and-budget-plan.md)** from investors.
3.  **Years 3-5:** Use the mandate and money to get major countries to sign the treaty, then start spending $27 billion per year on curing diseases.

That's it.

## Appendix: Referendums vs. Independent Expenditures

- **Referendums (where binding and timely):** Highest legitimacy; durable mandate; use when national or state mechanisms exist and timelines are practical.
- **Advisory signals (where no referendum):** Run scientifically credible polling or representative citizen assemblies; publish verified tallies per district.
- **Independent expenditures:** Fastest lever to translate district will into votes; pledge support for lawmakers who vote with their district's verified result (and oppose those who defy it), with strict noâ€‘coordination.
- **Hybrid playbook:** Use the global referendum for umbrella mandate; use country/district signals to direct lawful independent expenditures.

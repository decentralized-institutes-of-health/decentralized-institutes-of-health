# ðŸ“– Chapter 7: Strategy - How to Bribe Literally Everyone

Our strategy is not to win a moral argument. It is to bribe the shit out of literally everyone.

We will succeed by offering everyone a deal that's better than what they have now. When supporting the 1% Treaty makes you more money than opposing it, rational people support it.

## How Politics Actually Works

Politicians don't do things because they're moral. They do things because they get paid. Here's what we know about how this works:

- **People are greedy.** Politicians, corporate leaders, and voters choose whatever makes them richer or more powerful. Our strategy relies on this, not on people being good.

- **Small groups beat big groups.** A small group getting a lot of money will always fight harder than a big group losing a little money. We give the small groups massive benefits for supporting the treaty.

- **Politics is shopping.** Policy isn't decided by who has the best moral argument. It's decided by who offers the best deal. We're offering a better deal.

- **Everyone wants a cut.** Lobbyists and corporations will always try to grab money through politics. Instead of fighting this, we redirect it. We've created a new, more profitable way for them to get rich: the Peace Dividend.

We're not hoping people change. We're giving them better incentives.

## The Bribe Sequence: How We Pay Everyone Off

The strategy unfolds in a sequence of bribes, each one funding the next, creating an unstoppable coalition of self-interest.

### 1. The Bribe for Rich People

#### Phase 1: Seed Investors ($250-400M Initial Investment)

- **Who:** Wealthy individuals, funds, anchor investors, and the military-industrial complex itself.
- **The Bribe:** The most profitable investment opportunity in human history, modeled on the proven success of WWII War Bonds but with venture-capital-level returns.
- **40% Annual Returns:** **[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.md)** are designed to beat the world's best hedge funds (e.g., Renaissance Medallion Fund's ~39% CAGR).
- **Governance Over a $27B Treasury:** Investors don't just get a return; they get governance rights over a multi-billion-dollar annual, perpetual capital allocation engine. This "Governance Alpha" is an uncapped source of value and influence.
- **Money-Back Guarantee:** Initial funds are protected by an **[Assurance Contract](../economics/fundraising-strategy.md)**, guaranteeing a full refund if fundraising goals are not met.
- **The Result:** Defense contractors and billionaires make more money supporting peace than supporting war. So they support peace.

#### Our Superior Offer to Military Contractors:

1. **They Make More Money:** Direct investment in VICTORY bonds with >40% CAGR beats all alternative investment options
2. **They Get Better Security:** A healthier, more stable world is safer than one with overkill capacity creating existential risk  
3. **They Protect Their Families:** Their families get diseases too. They'd be better off profiting from funding cures rather than bombs
4. **Repurpose Their Lobbyists:** Instead of hiring new lobbyists, we legally bribe them with better returns to get their existing lobbying apparatus to push for the treaty

### 2. The Bribe for VICTORY Bond Buyers

#### Phase 2: VICTORY Bond Buyers ($100-200M Referendum Funding)

- **Who:** Early backers, health advocates, institutions
- **The Bribe:** VICTORY bonds representing earned ownership of real economic value created by the peace dividend
- **Governance control over $27B annually** in captured value from military budget redirection
- **Voting rights** on patient subsidies and research funding allocation  
- **Bond value backed by actual treasury growth** from when the treaty actually happens ($0 â†’ $27B)

### 3. The Bribe for Regular People

#### Phase 3: Citizens (Global Population)

- **Who:** Global population (targeting 3.5% = 280 million people)
- **The Bribe:** A large grant of **VOTE points** for each referendum voteâ€”your proof that you'll get paid real money. These represent your earned share of the $16.5 trillion annual peace dividend unlocked by redirecting military spending, convertible to **VICTORY bonds** after the 1% Treaty is ratified.
- **VOTE Points:** Every person who votes in our **[Global Referendum](./strategy/global-referendum/)** gets points. These aren't fake internet points. They represent real money.
- **You Get Paid:** After the treaty passes, those points become real ownership in the $27 billion annual health budget. You helped create it, you get a piece of it.
- **The Result:** Instead of a traditional protest where people wave signs and go home, we create 280 million people who have skin in the game. When 3.5% of the world's population wants something and will get paid for it, politicians listen.

### 4. The Bribe for Politicians

#### Phase 4: Politicians ($800M-1.5B Independent Expenditures)

- **Who:** Key legislators in target countries
- **The Bribe:** A package of personal wealth, political power, and a lasting legacy.

#### Our Superior Offer to Politicians:

- **Personal Investment Opportunity:** Politicians and their families can directly invest in [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.md) that pay better than anything else they can find, including defense stocks and traditional political corruption
- **Campaign Dominance:** Massive independent expenditure support for treaty supporters; equivalent opposition funding for defectors (no coordination)
- **Electoral Insurance:** The 3.5% public mandate makes supporting the treaty the politically safer choice
- **Political Insurance:** A new, highly popular policy platform that lets politicians claim credit for curing diseases and extending lifespans

#### What They Get:

- **A Personal Political War Chest:** We hand them an undeniable, popular mandate from the Global Referendum. They can use this massive wave of public supportâ€”which we built for themâ€”to crush their political opponents, consolidate power, and build a legacy. We are giving them the ultimate political weapon.
- **The Power to Reward Allies:** Signatory leaders gain the right to direct a portion of the DIH's multi-billion-dollar R&D budget to universities and companies **in their home districts**. This is a firehose of cash they can use to create jobs, reward their biggest financial backers, and stand at ribbon-cutting ceremonies for decades.
- **Enriched Elites:** We will offer privileged, early access to VICTORY Bonds to a nation's sovereign wealth funds and key financial institutions _contingent on their leader signing the treaty_. This creates a powerful domestic coalition of the nation's wealthiest and most influential players who will pressure their leader to sign the deal that makes them rich.

**The Result:** The choice for a leader is simple: accept a political and financial package that guarantees their personal power and enriches their allies, or be swept away by the tide. Compliance becomes the only rational choice.

## The Plan

Here's how we do it:

1.  **Months 0-3:** Set up the legal structure and hire smart people to run the campaign.
2.  **Months 4-36:** Launch the global referendum to get 280 million people to vote, and raise **[$1.2â€“$2.5 billion](./economics/fundraising-and-budget-plan.md)** from investors.
3.  **Years 3-5:** Use the mandate and money to get major countries to sign the treaty, then start spending $27 billion per year on curing diseases.

That's it.

## Appendix: Referendums vs. Independent Expenditures

- **Referendums (where binding and timely):** Highest legitimacy; durable mandate; use when national or state mechanisms exist and timelines are practical.
- **Advisory signals (where no referendum):** Run scientifically credible polling or representative citizen assemblies; publish verified tallies per district.
- **Independent expenditures:** Fastest lever to translate district will into votes; pledge support for lawmakers who vote with their district's verified result (and oppose those who defy it), with strict noâ€‘coordination.
- **Hybrid playbook:** Use the global referendum for umbrella mandate; use country/district signals to direct lawful independent expenditures.

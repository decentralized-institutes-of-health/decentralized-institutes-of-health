# ðŸ“– Chapter 4: The DIH - How to Spend $27 Billion Without Wasting It

The **Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)** is the globally-governed treasury that allocates the $27 billion raised by the 1% Treaty.

It is not a single, top-down bureaucracy. It is a SuperDAO that delegates authority to a network of specialized, subordinate DAOs (subDAOs), creating a "coalition of coalitions."

## How It Works

1.  **The DIH Treasury:** A non-profit, globally-governed SuperDAO holds the $27+ billion annual treasury.

2.  **Democratic Governance:** The DIH's budget and research agenda are managed using the **[Wishocracy governance protocol](./governance.md)**. This allows millions of people to democratically and efficiently allocate capital to the most promising research without being dominated by special interests.

3.  **A "Coalition of Coalitions" Structure:**
    -   Each subDAO focuses on a specific area of health, such as the **Decentralized Cancer Institute** or the **Decentralized Institute on Aging**.
    -   Governance of each subDAO is delegated to a coalition of the most effective non-profits, patient advocacy groups, and research institutions in that field, ensuring that funding decisions are made by true experts and the people who actually care about results.

This structure ensures that funding goes to the most promising research, as decided by a combination of expert and public opinion, rather than being allocated by a centralized committee.

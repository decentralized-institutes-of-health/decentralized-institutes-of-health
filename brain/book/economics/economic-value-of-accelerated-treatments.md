**Estimating the Economic Value of Accelerating Medical Progress Through New Therapies**

---

### **Introduction**

Understanding the economic value of new therapies is essential for evaluating the impact of accelerating medical progress. This article explores:

- The **average economic value** of a new therapy.
- The **total annual value** based on the average number of new therapies approved each year.
- An estimation of the potential value created by **accelerating medical progress by 80X**.

---

### **Average Economic Value of a New Therapy**

The value of a new therapy can be assessed through market performance and societal benefits:

- **Market Valuation:** Research estimates the average value of a successful new drug at **[$1.62 billion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07384)**.
- **Development Costs:** Drug development costs range from **[$314 million to $4.46 billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820562)** depending on therapeutic area and clinical complexity.

---

### **Annual Value Based on Average Approvals**

- **FDA Approvals:** The **[FDA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-025-00001-5)** approves around **50 new drugs annually**.
- **Total Annual Value:** Multiplying **50 approvals** by **$1.62 billion** yields an estimated **$81 billion** in economic value per year.

### **Impact of Accelerating Medical Progress by 80X**

What would happen if medical progress accelerated by 80-fold?

- **Hypothetical Annual Approvals:** 50 new therapies × 80 = **4,000 new therapies annually**.
- **Projected Economic Value:** 4,000 therapies × **$1.62 billion** = **$6.48 trillion** per year.

### **Considerations and Context**

- **Market Saturation:** Rapid introduction of therapies could lead to **price competition** and reduced per-drug economic value.
- **Healthcare System Capacity:** The healthcare infrastructure would need **substantial scaling** to manage increased development and distribution.
- **Societal Benefits:** Beyond direct economic value, accelerated medical progress could lead to **improved health outcomes**, **increased productivity**, and **reduced long-term healthcare costs**.

---

### **Conclusion**

Accelerating medical progress by 80X could generate **$6.48 trillion annually**, a dramatic increase from the current **$81 billion**. While market dynamics and system capacities are important considerations, the potential economic and societal impacts underscore the transformative value of advancing medical innovation.

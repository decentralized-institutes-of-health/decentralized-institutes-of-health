# Why This Beats Every Other Investment

## 1. The Deal

The world spends [**$2.72 trillion**](../references.md#global-military-spending) on war and [**$67.5 billion**](../references.md#global-gov-med-research-spending) on curing disease. That's 40:1. This is insane.

We want to spend **$1.2–$2.5 billion** to flip this permanently.

The plan is simple: take **$27+ billion per year** from military budgets and give it to health research instead. The people who lend us the money upfront get paid back with returns that beat **Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund (~39% per year)**—the best investment in history.

## 2. How It Works

### What We're Competing Against

Defense contractors make **~12-15% per year**. That's good, but not great.

The best investment in history is the **Renaissance Medallion Fund**, which made [**~39% per year**](../references.md#top-pe-hedge-funds) for 30 years straight.

We're going to beat that.

## 3. How We Beat the Best Investment in History

It's simple math.

**The Deal:**
1.  We target **~40% returns per year** (~28x over 10 years) for early investors.
2.  We never pay out more than 50% of what the health treasury makes each year.

**Why This Works:**

**A. The Leverage**
- **You give us:** $2.5 billion once.
- **We control:** $27 billion every year, forever.
- **That's 10.8x leverage.** This is why we can pay such high returns.

**B. The Scale**
We're not just redirecting money—we're capturing the biggest pile of wasted capital on Earth. The $27 billion we redirect is just 1% of global military spending, but it's 40X more than the world currently spends on curing disease.

## 4. The Math

Our [cash flow spreadsheet](./dih-treasury-cash-flow-model.md) shows exactly how this works. 

**If we only get half the money ($13B per year):** You still make 26x your money over 10 years.

**If we get the full $27B per year:** You make 28x your money over 10 years (40% annually).

### The Treasury Keeps Growing

We start by redirecting 1% of military spending. But the plan is to increase this percentage over time. This means more countries join, the treasury grows, and your returns get even better. For details, see [The Endgame: A Multi-Generational Strategy to Phase Out War](../strategy/the-endgame-phasing-out-war.md).

## 5. How We Price the Risk

The biggest question from investors is: "What are the odds this actually works?" 

We don't know for sure. Nobody does. So we're going to use prediction markets to figure it out in real time.

**How It Works:**

1.  **Prediction Markets:** We'll use Metaculus or Polymarket to bet on key milestones.
2.  **Key Questions:**
    - "Will the 1% Treaty be ratified by the US & EU before Q4 2028?"
    - "What will be the total redirected annual funding for the DIH Treasury by January 1, 2030?"
    - "Will the global referendum reach 100 million verified signatures by Q2 2026?"
3.  **Adjust Returns Based on Odds:** The predictions directly influence what we pay investors.

**Example:**
- If the market thinks we have a 60% chance of hitting the $27B target, we pay higher returns to compensate for the 40% risk.
- If the odds improve to 80% after a country signs on, we pay lower returns to new investors.

This turns political risk into something you can actually measure and price.

## 6. The Risk-Adjusted Math

**Simple math:** 40% beats 39%.

The Renaissance Medallion Fund made 39% per year for 30 years. We target 40% per year by using 10.8X leverage—you give us $2.5 billion, we control $27 billion per year.

**The Expected Value:**
- Medallion Fund: 39% return = $3.9M profit on $10M
- VICTORY Bonds: 40% return = $4M profit on $10M  

We beat the best by capturing political leverage that no hedge fund can access.

## 7. Why Lobbying Pays So Well (And How We Use It)

Oil companies and defense contractors make insane returns on lobbying because they know something most investors don't: buying politicians is the best investment in the world.

### The Numbers

- Oil companies spend $27 million on lobbying, get $220 million back. That's [**800% returns**](../references.md#fossil-fuel-lobbying-roi).
- Defense contractors spend $14 million on lobbying, get [$70.8 billion in contracts](../references.md#lockheed-2023-revenue). That's [**over 5,000% returns**](../references.md#military-lobbying-returns).

They get these returns because they're buying government spending. And government spending is the biggest pile of money in the world.

### How We Do the Same Thing (But for Curing Disease)

VICTORY Bonds work the same way, except instead of buying oil subsidies or weapon contracts, we're buying the 1% Treaty.

- **The Scale:** Instead of lobbying one country, we're lobbying the whole world.
- **The Multiplier:** A $1 investment could yield $100–$1,000+ in health spending.
- **The Control:** You don't just get the money back—you get to control how the $27B gets spent every year.

We're using the same system that makes oil companies and defense contractors rich, except we're using it to cure disease instead of start wars.

### The Legal Disclaimer

We can't promise you'll make money. Nobody can. Here's what we can say:

- **Goal:** Beat the best investments out there.
- **Money Source:** Your returns come from treaty money, capped at 50% of what we collect.
- **Transparency:** All the money flows are tracked on-chain, so you can see exactly what's happening.
- **Risks:** If politicians don't sign the treaty, you lose your money.

For legal details, see [Impact Securities and Digital Public Goods Financing Act (Draft)](../legal/impact-securities-reform.md#section-4a-marketing--disclosures-safe-harbor-plain-english-outcome-linked).

### Where the Money Really Comes From

The $27B treasury pays your returns. But the real source of value is the **$16.5 trillion we waste on war every year**. The treaty captures a tiny slice of this waste. For details, see [The Peace Dividend: Value Capture & Distribution Model](./peace-dividend-value-capture.md).


## 8. The Risks (And How We Deal With Them)

This could fail. Let's be honest about the risks and what we're doing about them.

### When You Get Paid

You get paid when the treaty money comes in, not on fixed dates. Details in [VICTORY Bonds Incentive Mechanics](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md):

- **Years 1-2**: Small payments (2–6%) from donations and early program money.
- **Years 3-5**: Big payments start 18–36 months after the first major country signs the treaty.
- **Years 5-10**: Full payback, plus you keep the voting rights over the $27B treasury forever.
- **If only 5 countries sign**: You still make 3.4x your money back in the first year.

### What Could Go Wrong

This isn't a normal startup. The risks are different. Here's what could kill this and what we're doing about it. For more, see [Investor Risk Analysis](./investor-risk-analysis.md).

- **Politicians Don't Sign**: We need 280M people to vote for the referendum. **How we fix it:** Metaculus markets price the risk in real time. If odds are low, we pay higher returns.
- **Legal Problems**: Building a global health treasury means dealing with lots of regulations. **How we fix it:** We launch in stages, use existing legal exemptions, and put everything on-chain so you can see what's happening.
- **We Run Out of Money**: If treaty money is delayed, you could lose your investment. **How we fix it:** First investors get paid first, we have insurance options, and you can track our cash position in real time.
- **Nobody Invests**: Early investors might worry we won't hit our funding target. **How we fix it:** Smart contract escrow. If we don't hit the target, you automatically get your money back. See [Fundraising Strategy](./fundraising-strategy.md).
- **Overall Odds**: Metaculus will track our chances in real time. Similar projects (like war bonds) have worked before, but we could have a 30%+ failure rate.

For all the details, see [VICTORY Bonds Incentive Mechanics](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md).


### For Philanthropists

If you're trying to save lives with your money, this beats every charity by a huge margin.

- **The Leverage**: A $1M investment could unlock $1B in health funding. That's 1,000X leverage—compared to [~10X for the best charities](../references.md#givewell-impact-multipliers) like malaria nets.
- **EA Principles**: This follows effective altruism logic—find the intervention that saves the most lives per dollar.
- **Risk Control**: Use Metaculus to bet on high-probability outcomes, and the democratic treasury ensures the money goes to the most effective treatments.

### For Defense Contractors

We want defense contractors as investors. If we pay them better returns than weapon sales, they'll lobby for the 1% Treaty instead of against it.

Game theory says this works better than fighting them. For details, see [Co-Opting Defense Contractors](../co-opting-defense-contractors.md).

# Why This Beats Every Other Investment

## 1. The Deal

The world spends [**$2.72 trillion**](../references.md#global-military-spending) on war and [**$67.5 billion**](../references.md#global-gov-med-research-spending) on curing disease. That's 40:1. This is insane.

We want to spend **$1.2–$2.5 billion** to flip this permanently.

The plan is simple: take **$27+ billion per year** from military budgets and give it to health research instead. The people who lend us the money upfront get paid back with **40% annual returns**—beating the best investment ever.

## 2. How We Beat the Best Investment Ever

The best investment in history made [**39% per year**](../references.md#top-pe-hedge-funds) for 30 years straight.

We target **40% per year** by using political leverage no hedge fund can access.

## 3. The Math

**Simple leverage:** You give us $2.5 billion, we control $27 billion per year. That's 10.8X leverage.

**The returns:** We target 40% annual returns, capped at 50% of treasury income. You make ~28X your money over 10 years.

**The scale:** We're capturing 1% of the world's biggest pile of wasted money—$2.7 trillion in military spending.

Our [cash flow spreadsheet](./dih-treasury-cash-flow-model.md) shows exactly how this works. Even if we only get half the money ($13B per year), you still make 26X your money over 10 years.

The treasury grows over time as more countries join. For details, see [The Endgame: A Multi-Generational Strategy to Phase Out War](../strategy/the-endgame-phasing-out-war.md).

## 4. How We Price the Risk

**The question:** What are the odds this actually works?

**The answer:** We use prediction markets (Metaculus, Polymarket) to find out in real time. If the odds are low, we pay higher returns. If the odds improve, we pay lower returns to new investors.

This turns political risk into something you can actually measure and price.

## 5. The Secret: Political Arbitrage

Defense contractors spend [$14 million on lobbying, get $70.8 billion in contracts](../references.md#military-lobbying-returns). That's 5,000% returns by buying government spending.

We're doing the same thing, but for curing disease instead of starting wars.



## 6. The Risks

This could fail. Here's what could go wrong and how we handle it:

**Politicians Don't Sign:** We need 280M people to vote for the referendum. **How we fix it:** Prediction markets price the risk in real time. If odds are low, we pay higher returns.

**We Run Out of Money:** If treaty money is delayed, you could lose your investment. **How we fix it:** First investors get paid first, and you can track our cash position in real time.

**Nobody Invests:** Early investors might worry we won't hit our funding target. **How we fix it:** Smart contract escrow. If we don't hit the target, you automatically get your money back.

**When You Get Paid:** You get paid when treaty money comes in, not on fixed dates. Big payments start 18–36 months after the first major country signs.

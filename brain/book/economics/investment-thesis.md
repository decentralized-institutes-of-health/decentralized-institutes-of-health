# Why This Beats Every Other Investment

## 1. The Deal

The world spends [**$2.72 trillion**](../references.md#global-military-spending) on war and [**$67.5 billion**](../references.md#global-gov-med-research-spending) on curing disease. That's 40:1. This is insane.

We want to spend **$1.2–$2.5 billion** to flip this permanently.

The plan is simple: take **$27+ billion per year** from military budgets and give it to health research instead. The people who lend us the money upfront get paid back with returns that beat **Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund (~39% per year)**—the best investment in history.

## 2. How We Beat the Best Investment Ever

The best investment in history is the **Renaissance Medallion Fund**, which made [**~39% per year**](../references.md#top-pe-hedge-funds) for 30 years straight.

We target **40% per year** by using political leverage no hedge fund can access.

## 3. The Math

**Simple leverage:** You give us $2.5 billion, we control $27 billion per year. That's 10.8X leverage.

**The returns:** We target 40% annual returns, capped at 50% of treasury income. You make ~28X your money over 10 years.

**The scale:** We're capturing 1% of the world's biggest pile of wasted money—$2.7 trillion in military spending.

Our [cash flow spreadsheet](./dih-treasury-cash-flow-model.md) shows exactly how this works. Even if we only get half the money ($13B per year), you still make 26X your money over 10 years.

The treasury grows over time as more countries join. For details, see [The Endgame: A Multi-Generational Strategy to Phase Out War](../strategy/the-endgame-phasing-out-war.md).

## 4. How We Price the Risk

The biggest question from investors is: "What are the odds this actually works?" 

We don't know for sure. Nobody does. So we're going to use prediction markets to figure it out in real time.

**How It Works:**

We use prediction markets (Metaculus, Polymarket) to bet on key milestones. If the odds are low, we pay higher returns. If the odds improve, we pay lower returns to new investors.

This turns political risk into something you can actually measure and price.

## 5. Why This Beats Everything

**Simple math:** We're doing what defense contractors do, but better.

Defense contractors spend [$14 million on lobbying, get $70.8 billion in contracts](../references.md#military-lobbying-returns). That's 5,000% returns by buying government spending.

We're doing the same thing, except:
- **Better scale:** We're lobbying the whole world, not one country
- **Better returns:** 40% beats the best hedge fund ever (39%)
- **Better cause:** Curing disease instead of starting wars

Bottom line: 40% beats 39%.

### The Legal Disclaimer

We can't promise you'll make money. Nobody can. Here's what we can say:

- **Goal:** Beat the best investments out there.
- **Money Source:** Your returns come from treaty money, capped at 50% of what we collect.
- **Transparency:** All the money flows are tracked on-chain, so you can see exactly what's happening.
- **Risks:** If politicians don't sign the treaty, you lose your money.

For legal details, see [Impact Securities and Digital Public Goods Financing Act (Draft)](../legal/impact-securities-reform.md#section-4a-marketing--disclosures-safe-harbor-plain-english-outcome-linked).

### Where the Money Really Comes From

The $27B treasury pays your returns. But the real source of value is the **$16.5 trillion we waste on war every year**. The treaty captures a tiny slice of this waste. For details, see [The Peace Dividend: Value Capture & Distribution Model](./peace-dividend-value-capture.md).


## 6. The Risks (And How We Deal With Them)

This could fail. Let's be honest about the risks and what we're doing about them.

### When You Get Paid

You get paid when the treaty money comes in, not on fixed dates. Details in [VICTORY Bonds Incentive Mechanics](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md):

- **Years 1-2**: Small payments (2–6%) from donations and early program money.
- **Years 3-5**: Big payments start 18–36 months after the first major country signs the treaty.
- **Years 5-10**: Full payback at 40% annual returns.
- **If only 5 countries sign**: You still make 3.4x your money back in the first year.

### What Could Go Wrong

Three main risks:

- **Politicians Don't Sign**: We need 280M people to vote for the referendum. **How we fix it:** Metaculus markets price the risk in real time. If odds are low, we pay higher returns.
- **We Run Out of Money**: If treaty money is delayed, you could lose your investment. **How we fix it:** First investors get paid first, and you can track our cash position in real time.
- **Nobody Invests**: Early investors might worry we won't hit our funding target. **How we fix it:** Smart contract escrow. If we don't hit the target, you automatically get your money back.

# Why This Beats Every Other Investment

## 1. The Deal

The world spends [**$2.72 trillion**](../references.md#global-military-spending) on war and [**$67.5 billion**](../references.md#global-gov-med-research-spending) on curing disease. That's 40:1. This is insane.

We want to spend **$1.2–$2.5 billion** to flip this permanently.

The plan is simple: take **$27+ billion per year** from military budgets and give it to health research instead. The people who lend us the money upfront get paid back with returns that beat **Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund (~39% per year)**—the best investment in history.

### Our Core Strategic Choice: Two Models for Funding

To raise the $1–2.5 billion required to pass the 1% Treaty, we are debating two primary fundraising models. This is the most important strategic decision we will make, and we are actively seeking feedback on which path is more likely to succeed.

**Model A: The Strategic Partner (Governance Alpha) Model**

*   **The Pitch:** Target a small group of elite, activist investors who can act as strategic partners in the political fight.
*   **The Offer:** A high return (~40% CAGR) **plus** permanent governance rights over the $27B annual treasury.
*   **Pros:** Attracts powerful, politically-connected "generals" who can help us win. Their permanent oversight could enforce ruthless efficiency. The non-cash "Governance Alpha" component allows for a lower cash payout, preserving more of the treasury for the mission.
*   **Cons:** "Governance Alpha" is complex and may confuse some investors. It introduces a permanent, unelected power bloc into the institution, which could be seen as "toxic" or undemocratic.

**Model B: The Public Good (Simple Bond) Model**

*   **The Pitch:** Target a broader audience of impact investors, foundations, and the general public who are motivated by the mission and a clean financial return.
*   **The Offer:** A higher, cash-only return (e.g., ~50-60% CAGR to ensure the risk-adjusted return is compelling) with no governance rights. Investors are paid back their multiple and then they are out.
*   **Pros:** Brilliantly simple and easy to understand. It is more transparently democratic and open to a wider range of investors.
*   **Cons:** May fail to attract the powerful, "shark" investors whose political muscle is necessary to win. The higher cash payout required to compensate for the lack of governance could significantly drain the treasury in its early years, hamstringing the mission.

The remainder of this document provides a deep dive into the mechanics and logic of **Model A**, as it is the more complex of the two strategies. We currently believe it is the more pragmatic path to victory, but we are open to being convinced otherwise.

## 2. Deep Dive: The Strategic Partner Model

### What We're Competing Against

Defense contractors make **~12-15% per year**. That's good, but not great.

The best investment in history is the **Renaissance Medallion Fund**, which made [**~39% per year**](../references.md#top-pe-hedge-funds) for 30 years straight.

We're going to beat that.

## 3. How We Beat 39% Returns

It's simple math.

**The Deal:**
1.  We target **~40% returns per year** (~28x over 10 years) for early investors.
2.  We never pay out more than 50% of what the health treasury makes each year.

**Why This Works:**

**A. The Leverage**
- **You give us:** $2.5 billion once.
- **We control:** $27 billion every year, forever.
- **That's 10.8x leverage.** This is why we can pay such high returns.

**B. You Also Get to Control the Money**
Beyond cash returns, you get voting rights over the **$27 billion annual health treasury**. You can:
- Fund the diseases you care about.
- Launch million-dollar prize challenges.
- Start biotech companies with treasury money.

No other investment gives you control over $27 billion per year.

## 4. The Math

Our [cash flow spreadsheet](./dih-treasury-cash-flow-model.md) shows exactly how this works. 

**If we only get half the money ($13B per year):** You still make 26x your money over 10 years.

**If we get the full $27B per year:** You make 28x your money over 10 years (40% annually).

### The Treasury Keeps Growing

We start by redirecting 1% of military spending. But the plan is to increase this percentage over time. This means the treasury grows, and your voting rights become worth more every year. For details, see [The Endgame: A Multi-Generational Strategy to Phase Out War](../strategy/the-endgame-phasing-out-war.md).

## 5. How We Price the Risk

The biggest question from investors is: "What are the odds this actually works?" 

We don't know for sure. Nobody does. So we're going to use prediction markets to figure it out in real time.

**How It Works:**

1.  **Prediction Markets:** We'll use Metaculus or Polymarket to bet on key milestones.
2.  **Key Questions:**
    - "Will the 1% Treaty be ratified by the US & EU before Q4 2028?"
    - "What will be the total redirected annual funding for the DIH Treasury by January 1, 2030?"
    - "Will the global referendum reach 100 million verified signatures by Q2 2026?"
3.  **Adjust Returns Based on Odds:** The predictions directly influence what we pay investors.

**Example:**
- If the market thinks we have a 60% chance of hitting the $27B target, we pay higher returns to compensate for the 40% risk.
- If the odds improve to 80% after a country signs on, we pay lower returns to new investors.

This turns political risk into something you can actually measure and price.

## 6. VICTORY Bonds vs. The Medallion Fund

Here's the real test: Is this better than the best investment in history?

### Proving the Need for Governance Alpha

A simple expected value calculation on the cash returns alone *intentionally falls short* of the Medallion benchmark. This is by design, as it mathematically proves that the majority of the investment's value is derived from the governance rights.

**The Math on Cash Returns:**
- An investment in the Medallion Fund has an expected value of **$13.9M** on a $10M investment (a 39% return).
- The expected value of the cash portion of a VICTORY Bond is: `(70% × $14M) + (30% × $0) = $9.8M`.

This isn't a weakness in the model; it's the entire point. It proves that a simple bond could never compete. The investment is only superior when you include the immense value of controlling a $27 billion annual treasury.

### How We Beat the Benchmark

To be a better investment, the total risk-adjusted value must exceed Medallion's $13.9M.

`(EV of Cash Returns) + (EV of Governance Alpha) > $13.9M`
`$9.8M + (70% * Value of Governance Alpha) > $13.9M`

This means the value of the governance rights in a success scenario must be priced at over **$5.86 million** on a $10M investment. Given the ability to direct billions in funding, incubate companies, and shape the future of global health, this valuation is extremely conservative.

The Governance Alpha is what makes this the best investment in the world.

## 7. Why Lobbying Pays So Well (And How We Use It)

Oil companies and defense contractors make insane returns on lobbying because they know something most investors don't: buying politicians is the best investment in the world.

### The Numbers

- Oil companies spend $27 million on lobbying, get $220 million back. That's [**800% returns**](../references.md#fossil-fuel-lobbying-roi).
- Defense contractors spend $14 million on lobbying, get [$70.8 billion in contracts](../references.md#lockheed-2023-revenue). That's [**over 5,000% returns**](../references.md#military-lobbying-returns).

They get these returns because they're buying government spending. And government spending is the biggest pile of money in the world.

### How We Do the Same Thing (But for Curing Disease)

VICTORY Bonds work the same way, except instead of buying oil subsidies or weapon contracts, we're buying the 1% Treaty.

- **The Scale:** Instead of lobbying one country, we're lobbying the whole world.
- **The Multiplier:** A $1 investment could yield $100–$1,000+ in health spending.
- **The Control:** You don't just get the money back—you get to control how the $27B gets spent every year.

We're using the same system that makes oil companies and defense contractors rich, except we're using it to cure disease instead of start wars.

### The Legal Disclaimer

We can't promise you'll make money. Nobody can. Here's what we can say:

- **Goal:** Beat the best investments out there.
- **Money Source:** Your returns come from treaty money, capped at 50% of what we collect.
- **Transparency:** All the money flows are tracked on-chain, so you can see exactly what's happening.
- **Risks:** If politicians don't sign the treaty, you lose your money.

For legal details, see [Impact Securities and Digital Public Goods Financing Act (Draft)](../legal/impact-securities-reform.md#section-4a-marketing--disclosures-safe-harbor-plain-english-outcome-linked).

### Where the Money Really Comes From

The $27B treasury pays your returns. But the real source of value is the **$16.5 trillion we waste on war every year**. The treaty captures a tiny slice of this waste. For details, see [The Peace Dividend: Value Capture & Distribution Model](./peace-dividend-value-capture.md).


## 8. The Risks (And How We Deal With Them)

This could fail. Let's be honest about the risks and what we're doing about them.

### When You Get Paid

You get paid when the treaty money comes in, not on fixed dates. Details in [VICTORY Bonds Incentive Mechanics](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md):

- **Years 1-2**: Small payments (2–6%) from donations and early program money.
- **Years 3-5**: Big payments start 18–36 months after the first major country signs the treaty.
- **Years 5-10**: Full payback, plus you keep the voting rights over the $27B treasury forever.
- **If only 5 countries sign**: You still make 3.4x your money back in the first year.

### What Could Go Wrong

This isn't a normal startup. The risks are different. Here's what could kill this and what we're doing about it. For more, see [Investor Risk Analysis](./investor-risk-analysis.md).

- **Politicians Don't Sign**: We need 280M people to vote for the referendum. **How we fix it:** Metaculus markets price the risk in real time. If odds are low, we pay higher returns.
- **Legal Problems**: Building a global health treasury means dealing with lots of regulations. **How we fix it:** We launch in stages, use existing legal exemptions, and put everything on-chain so you can see what's happening.
- **We Run Out of Money**: If treaty money is delayed, you could lose your investment. **How we fix it:** First investors get paid first, we have insurance options, and you can track our cash position in real time.
- **Nobody Invests**: Early investors might worry we won't hit our funding target. **How we fix it:** Smart contract escrow. If we don't hit the target, you automatically get your money back. See [Fundraising Strategy](./fundraising-strategy.md).
- **Overall Odds**: Metaculus will track our chances in real time. Similar projects (like war bonds) have worked before, but we could have a 30%+ failure rate.

For all the details, see [VICTORY Bonds Incentive Mechanics](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md).


### For Philanthropists

If you're trying to save lives with your money, this beats every charity by a huge margin.

- **The Leverage**: A $1M investment could unlock $1B in health funding. That's 1,000X leverage—compared to [~10X for the best charities](../references.md#givewell-impact-multipliers) like malaria nets.
- **EA Principles**: This follows effective altruism logic—find the intervention that saves the most lives per dollar.
- **Risk Control**: Use Metaculus to bet on high-probability outcomes, and your voting rights ensure the money goes where you want.

### For Defense Contractors

We want defense contractors as investors. If we pay them better returns than weapon sales, they'll lobby for the 1% Treaty instead of against it.

Game theory says this works better than fighting them. For details, see [Co-Opting Defense Contractors](../co-opting-defense-contractors.md).

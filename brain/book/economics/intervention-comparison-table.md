## Introduction

This article compares the dFDA platform to other historically high-ROI and high-QALY-per-dollar health interventions. The table below summarizes the best available data for each intervention, including return on investment (ROI), cost per QALY gained (ICER), and estimated QALYs gained per $1 million spent. This provides context for the scale and efficiency of dFDA relative to foundational public health measures.

_Note: The bar represents the mid-point of the uncertainty range, and the error bars indicate the lower and upper bounds of the estimate. For "Smallpox Eradication," the upper bound is illustrative of its high, open-ended impact._

**Key:**

- **ROI**: Return on investment; dollars saved or value created per $1 spent.
- **Cost per QALY Gained (ICER)**: Lower is better; "Dominant" means saves money and improves health. Values may be in USD ($) or GBP (£).
- **QALYs Gained per $1M**: Rough estimate, varies by context and population.

## Conclusion

The dFDA platform is projected to have a higher ROI and more QALYs per dollar than almost any other single health intervention, rivaled only by foundational public health measures like smallpox eradication and mass vaccination in low-resource settings. Most other interventions, while highly cost-effective, do not approach the systemic leverage or scale of dFDA.

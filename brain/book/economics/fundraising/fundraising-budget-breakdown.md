# Fundraising & Budget Plan: The Activation Energy

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the total capital required to successfully implement the 1% Treaty and establish the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH). It is a supporting document for the overall strategy described in the [War on Disease Landing Page](../strategy/warondisease-landing.md). The figures presented here are the basis for our **$1.2B - $2.5B total fundraising goal**.

## 1. Executive Summary: The "Activation Energy"

The capital raised is not for ongoing operations; it is a one-time "activation energy" required to overcome the political inertia of the current system. This investment is designed to unlock a perpetual, multi-generational funding stream of **$27+ billion annually** for global health.

**Note on Diligence Documents:** This document provides the high-level strategic budget. A detailed, bottom-up operational budget and a description of our full, spreadsheet-based financial model are available in our [Operational Budget & Financial Model Documentation](./operational-budget-and-financial-model.md).

The budget is structured around a 36-month timeline and is divided into four primary operational categories.

## 2. Total Fundraising Requirement: $1.2B - $2.5B

The range reflects the variable nature of political campaigns and the potential to scale our efforts. A smaller, more targeted raise of $1.2B is considered the minimum viable amount, while a $2.5B raise would allow for a massively parallel, global campaign with a significantly higher probability of success.

### Multi-Phase Fundraising Strategy

The raise will be conducted in tranches, with each tranche tied to the achievement of specific, verifiable milestones.

1.  **Phase 1: Seed Round ($250M - $400M)**
    - **Goal:** To fund the development of the global referendum platform, establish the legal frameworks in pilot countries, and run the first electoral cycle interventions.
    - **Milestone to Unlock Phase 2:** Secure 50 million verified referendum participants and/or secure a pro-treaty legislative majority in a pilot G20 nation.

2.  **Phase 2: Series A ($500M - $1B)**
    - **Goal:** To expand political operations to all G7 nations and achieve the 3.5% global participation threshold (280 million people).
    - **Milestone to Unlock Phase 3:** Achieve the 3.5% threshold and/or secure the first national treaty commitment from a G7 nation.

3.  **Phase 3: Growth Round ($500M - $1.1B)**
    - **Goal:** To ensure treaty ratification in all major powers (US, EU, China) and fully capitalize the DIH treasury for its first year of operation.
    - **Milestone:** Full operational deployment and the first $1B disbursement.

## 3. Phased Operational Budget & Justification

The budget is not a monolithic block but is designed to be deployed in phases, directly corresponding to our fundraising tranches. This ensures that capital is used efficiently and that spending scales only with the achievement of verifiable milestones.

### Phase 1: Seed ($250M - $400M)

This initial phase is designed to build the core infrastructure and prove the model in a limited number of high-impact pilot regions.

| :----------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operations**     | $10-15M   | Based on a team of 20 with a fully-loaded average cost of $250k/year for a 2-year runway.                                                 |
| **Platform MVP**   | $50-75M   | Includes a 50-person engineering team/contractor budget, plus 3 independent security audits ($5M), and cloud infrastructure costs ($10M). |
| **Legal (Pilots)** | $40-60M   | Based on retaining 5 top-tier global law firms ($5M/year each) and 3 lobbying firms ($5M/year each) for a 2-year period.                  |

| **Platform Scale-Up**   | $100-150M | Budget for scaling the platform to 300M+ users, including global CDN, security, and compliance features (e.g., GDPR).                          |

| :----------------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Saturation Campaigns** | $300-750M | All-out media and political pressure in the final 1-3 holdout nations, which will be the most expensive to win.                                                                                  |

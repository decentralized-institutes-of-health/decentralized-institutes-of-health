## VICTORY Instruments: The Investment in Humanity

To bootstrap this new economic model, the DIH will raise its initial capital by issuing two classes of **VICTORY Instruments**, each designed for a specific purpose and audience.

### 1. VICTORY Bonds (For Investors)

Modeled on the War Bonds that funded victory in WWII, VICTORY Bonds are the primary instrument for capitalizing the DIH Treasury. They are a debt-like instrument with a fixed coupon and defined maturity, designed to offer a superior, de-risked return to accredited and institutional investors.

- **A >40% Targeted Annual Return:** We offer VICTORY Bonds engineered to deliver a risk-adjusted expected value superior to the world's most elite hedge funds (e.g., Renaissance Medallion Fund's ~39% CAGR).
- **Governance Over a $27B Treasury:** Investors don't just get a return; they get governance rights over a multi-billion-dollar annual, perpetual capital allocation engine.
- **A De-Risked Bet:** Initial investments are protected by an **[Assurance Contract](./fundraising-strategy.md)**, guaranteeing a full refund if fundraising goals are not met.

### 2. VICTORY Tokens (For Participants)

VICTORY Tokens are the primary instrument for incentivizing mass participation in the global referendum. They are a utility token used to reward verifiable actions (like voting and referrals) and may confer governance rights over the DIH treasury. They are not designed to promise profits, which helps mitigate securities risk for a broad, global distribution.

This dual-instrument approach allows the DIH to attract the most ambitious capital while simultaneously building a broad, global coalition of engaged participants.

# The Endgame: A Multi-Generational Strategy to Phase Out War

## 1. The Vision: Beyond the 1% Treaty

The initial 1% Treaty is not the end goal; it is the beginning. It is the crucial first step in a multi-generational strategy designed to systematically and peacefully render organized violence economically obsolete.

Our long-term vision is to create a world where the economic incentives for cooperation, health, and prosperity so vastly outweigh the incentives for conflict that war becomes a relic of a less rational past. The 1% Treaty is the beachheadâ€”it establishes the global precedent, the legal frameworks, and the financial infrastructure necessary for a much larger-scale reallocation of resources over the next century.

## 2. The Mechanism: Incremental, Ratcheting Reallocation

Once the DIH treasury and the VICTORY Bond ecosystem are proven to be efficient, transparent, and effective at deploying capital, we will begin the process of incrementally increasing the redirection percentage.

- **The Process:** Every 5-10 years, a new global referendum will be initiated to increase the redirection by a small, politically palatable amount (e.g., an additional 0.5% or 1%).
- **The Ratchet Effect:** Each successful increase will further expand the DIH treasury, which in turn provides more funding for health, creates more value for VICTORY holders, and builds a larger coalition of stakeholders (universities, companies, patient groups) who will advocate for the _next_ increase. This creates a self-reinforcing flywheel for peace.
- **The Goal:** Over a period of 100-200 years, we can systematically and voluntarily redirect the vast majority of resources currently spent on military endeavors towards solving humanity's greatest challenges: disease, aging, poverty, and climate change.

## 3. The Economic Inevitability

This strategy is not based on a utopian hope for a change in human nature, but on a pragmatic understanding of incentives. As the DIH's budget grows from \$27 billion to \$100 billion, to \$500 billion, and eventually to over a trillion dollars annually, the economic gravity will shift.

- The world's most talented scientists and engineers will be drawn to the massive opportunities in health and longevity research.
- The world's largest investors will see that the greatest returns are found in curing disease, not in building weapons.
- Nations will find that true security and global influence come not from their capacity for destruction, but from their contributions to human flourishing.

## 4. Implications for VICTORY Token Holders

This long-term vision is the ultimate source of value for VICTORY bond holders. The initial investment thesis is based on governance over a \$27 billion annual treasury. However, the true value is governance over a treasury that is designed to **grow perpetually**.

An investment in VICTORY is an investment in a system designed to systematically capture the peace dividend, making it an asset with a potential for multi-generational value appreciation unlike any other in financial history.

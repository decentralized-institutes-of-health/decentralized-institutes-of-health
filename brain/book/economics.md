# ðŸ“– Chapter 4: The Economics - Unlocking Trillion-Dollar Dividends

This isn't a non-profit. It's a machine for converting the two most destructive forces in the worldâ€”war and diseaseâ€”into the two most productive: peace and health.

The core economic argument is simple:
1.  There are trillions of dollars in latent value locked up in our broken systems. We call this the **Peace Dividend** (from ending war) and the **Health Dividend** (from curing disease).
2.  This value has never been realized because no one has a credible mechanism to capture it. It's like having a dam full of water without a turbine.
3.  We have built the turbine. The DIH and dFDA are a system for converting this latent potential into measurable economic and social value.
4.  To start the turbine, we need "activation energy." **[VICTORY Bonds](./economics/victory-bonds.md)** are the instrument we use to raise this initial capital.
5.  The value we unlock is then used to repay the investors who provided the activation energy, with returns that rival the best hedge funds in the world.

This chapter details the math behind this machine.

## How the Money Goes Around

Here's how it works:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Investors & Citizens] -- purchase --> B(VICTORY Bonds);
    B -- funds --> C{DIH Treasury};
    C -- finances --> D[Hyper-Efficient Medical R&D];
    D -- produces --> E[Cures, Health & Economic Productivity];
    E -- justifies --> F(The 1% Treaty);
    F -- sovereign contributions --> C;
    C -- repays --> A;
```

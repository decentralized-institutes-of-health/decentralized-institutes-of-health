# 📖 Chapter 1: Problem - We're Doing This Backwards

Humanity has two core problems:
1.  **We spend our money on killing people instead of curing them.**
2.  **The systems we have for curing them are catastrophically broken.**

We spend trillions on war and almost nothing on disease. Disease costs us **[~$244 trillion](./economics/cost-of-disease.md)** every year. War costs each person **[~$74,259](./reference/costs-of-war.md)** over their lifetime.

We are paying to die instead of paying to live. This is insane.

## Part I: We Fund Bombs Instead of Cures

The world spends **[$2.4 trillion every year on weapons](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2024/world-military-expenditure-surges-amid-war-rising-tensions-and-insecurity)**. That's money we could use to solve actual problems.

Instead, we use it to blow things up. You can't cure cancer with bombs. You can't fix climate change while building more missiles. You can't end poverty while funding armies. We are bailing water out of a sinking ship while others are paid handsomely to drill more holes in the hull.

## Part II: Our Medical System is a Bureaucratic Nightmare

While we waste trillions on weapons, the system for creating new medicines is also broken. It's not a money problem; it's a *system* problem. The two main culprits are the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

- **The NIH is a black hole of wasted genius.** It forces the world's best scientists to spend 40% of their time begging for money instead of doing research. [Learn more](./problem/nih-funding-is-broken.md).
- **The FDA kills more people than it saves.** Its approval process is so slow and expensive that it delays life-saving drugs for years and makes it impossible to cure rare diseases. [Learn more](./problem/fda-approvals-are-broken.md).

Here's a summary of the damage:

- **💸 ~$2.2 Billion** to develop one new treatment.
- **🐢 17 years** from discovery to patient.
- **🚫 85% of patients** are forbidden from trials.
- **💊 95% of rare diseases** have NO approved treatments.
- **🙈 Negative results are hidden**, wasting billions on repeated failures.
- **🧫 44 years** since we last eradicated a disease.

The system is designed to protect bureaucrats, not patients. We're fighting 21st-century diseases with 20th-century bureaucracy. This is what we're going to fix.

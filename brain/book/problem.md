# 📖 Chapter 1: We're Doing This Backwards

We spend trillions on killing people and almost nothing on curing them.

Disease costs us **[~$244 trillion](./economics/cost-of-disease.md)** every year globally. War costs each person **[~$74,259](./reference/costs-of-war.md)** over their lifetime.

We're paying to die instead of paying to live. This is insane.

## Part I: Where the Money Goes

The world spends **[$2.4 trillion every year on weapons](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2024/world-military-expenditure-surges-amid-war-rising-tensions-and-insecurity)**. That's money we could use to solve actual problems.

Instead, we use it to blow things up. You can't cure cancer with bombs. You can't fix climate change while building more missiles. You can't end poverty while funding armies.

- **Environmental Collapse:** The war in Ukraine **[destroyed 20% of the nation's protected areas](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ukraine-assessing-environmental-damage-war)** in months. The Gulf War's oil fires **[burned for 10 months](https://www.britannica.com/event/Persian-Gulf-War/Environmental-consequences)**, releasing more carbon than the annual emissions of most countries. The US military is the **[top global polluter](https://earth.org/military-pollution/)**.
- **Humanitarian Crisis:** Nearly all starvation today is **[caused by violent conflict](https://www.wfp.org/conflict-and-hunger)**. Conflicts create more poverty than aid organizations can possibly solve.

We are bailing water out of a sinking ship while others are paid handsomely to drill more holes in the hull.

## Part II: How We Waste Money on Medicine

While we waste trillions on weapons, the system for creating new medicines is also broken. It's slow, expensive, and stupid.

Here's how bad it is:

- **💸 ~$43,000** is the cost per participant in a traditional clinical trial.
- **💸 ~$2.2 Billion** is the cost to develop a single new treatment, a cost that ultimately falls on patients.
- **🐢 17 years of suffering** is the average time between the discovery of a new treatment and its arrival to patients.
- **🚫 85% of patients are forbidden** from participating in the clinical trials that might save their lives.
- **☠️ 21,000 to 120,000 people die** each decade due to slow and suboptimal regulatory processes.
- **💊 95% of rare diseases have NO FDA-approved treatments**, because it's impossible to recover a billion-dollar investment from a small patient population.
- **🙈 Negative results are never published**, leading to billions of dollars being wasted by researchers repeating the same failed experiments.
- **📊 No Treatment Effectiveness Rankings:** The existing system does not give us a ranked list of the most safe and effective treatments for a given condition.
- **🥫 No Data on Unpatentable Substances:** We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of the cocktail of over 330 chemical additives we consume.
- **🗓️ No Long-Term Outcome Data:** Current trials often only last a few months, so we have no idea what the long-term positive or negative effects of a drug are.
- **⚛️ 166 billion potential treatments** with drug-like properties have not been tested.
- **🌍 2 billion people** are suffering from diseases that remain uncured.
- **🧫 It has been 44 years** since we last eradicated a disease (smallpox in 1980).

The current system makes money for drug companies and bureaucrats, not cures for patients. It's broken.

We're fighting 21st-century diseases with 20th-century bureaucracy. This is what we're going to fix.

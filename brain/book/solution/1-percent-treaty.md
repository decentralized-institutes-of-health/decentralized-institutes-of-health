# ðŸ“– Chapter 3: The 1% Treaty - How We Get the Money

This is the funding mechanism. **The 1% Treaty** is a binding global accord for every nation to redirect 1% of its annual military budget to a shared, open-source protocol for curing disease.

This is not charity. It is a direct upgrade to our model of global security and a massive investment in human and economic potential.

## The Simple Logic of Mutual Survival

The case for the 1% Treaty rests on a simple proof:

1.  Governments spend over **$2 trillion per year on military force** to maintain a balance of power against other nations. The primary goal is to avoid being attacked.
2.  If every nation simultaneously reduces its military budget by 1% and contributes that amount to a global fund, **the relative balance of power remains identical**. No nation becomes weaker relative to its rivals.
3.  Therefore, with no change in relative military risk, every nation on Earth gains access to a massive, perpetually funded engine for biomedical innovation that will cure the diseases afflicting their own citizens.

It is the single most rational action humanity can take.

## A New Definition of National Security

By turning humanity's competitive drive away from destruction and towards healing, we create a world that is not only healthier but fundamentally safer.

- **Planetary Defense Against Pandemics:** A globally funded, always-on research network is the ultimate defense against the existential threat of natural or engineered pandemics.
- **Strengthening Nations from Within:** A nation's true strength is the health and productivity of its people. Curing diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and diabetes strengthens national economies, reduces social instability, and prevents the internal conflicts that often spill across borders.
- **Reducing the Capacity for War:** A 1% reduction in military spending is a direct 1% reduction in the resources available for conflict. It is a tangible step away from mutually assured destruction and towards mutually assured survival.

This is how we capture the peace dividend and build a future where our greatest collective achievements are not weapons of war, but cures for disease.

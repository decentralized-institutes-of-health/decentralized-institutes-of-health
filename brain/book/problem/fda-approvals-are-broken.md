# Why FDA Approvals Kill More People Than They Save

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a noble mission: to ensure that new treatments are safe and effective. The reality is a system that protects bureaucrats' careers at the cost of patients' lives.

The modern clinical trial system is a masterpiece of bureaucratic inefficiency. It's designed to minimize the risk of a bureaucrat approving a bad drug, even if it means maximizing the number of people who die while waiting for a good one.

## The $2.2 Billion, 17-Year Obstacle Course

Here's the process the FDA forces every new treatment to go through:

- **Phase I (Safety):** Test on a few dozen healthy people to make sure it's not poison.
- **Phase II (Efficacy):** Test on a few hundred sick people to see if it does anything.
- **Phase III (Comparison):** Test on a few thousand sick people to see if it's better than what already exists.

This process is why it costs **$2.2 billion** and takes **17 years** to get a single new treatment to market.

### The Per-Patient Cost: $41,000

The absurd level of data collection and administrative overhead required by the FDA is why it costs **$41,000 per patient** to participate in a clinical trial. This cost is the single biggest reason why medical research is so expensive.

- **Exclusionary:** Because it's so expensive, 85% of patients who want to participate in trials are excluded.
- **No Cures for Rare Diseases:** It's impossible to recoup a $2.2 billion investment from a small patient population, which is why 95% of rare diseases have zero FDA-approved treatments.

## Designed for CYA (Cover Your Ass)

The entire system is built on a perverse incentive structure for the regulators.

- **Approve a bad drug (Type I error):** You get fired. The media calls you a murderer. Your career is over.
- **Reject a good drug (Type II error):** Nothing happens. The people who would have been saved by the drug die quietly. No one ever knows you made a mistake.

If you're a rational bureaucrat, you will always choose to delay or reject, because there is no personal downside. The result is a system that is pathologically slow and risk-averse.

## The Body Count of Bureaucracy

This isn't a theoretical problem. The FDA's slowness has a real body count.

- **Beta-Blockers:** The FDA's 10-year delay in approving beta-blockers after they were widely used in Europe is estimated to have cost **over 200,000 American lives**.
- **COVID-19:** The CDC and FDA's initial refusal to approve private COVID-19 tests in the crucial early weeks of the pandemic allowed the virus to spread uncontrollably across the country.

We are letting a legion of paper-pushers in Bethesda make life-or-death decisions for millions of people, and they are consistently getting it wrong. Their incentive is to protect their jobs, not to save your life.

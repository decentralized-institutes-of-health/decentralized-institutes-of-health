# ðŸ“– Chapter 2: Solution - The Complete System

The solution isn't complicated. It doesn't require changing human nature. It just requires changing what pays.

Here's the complete system that makes curing people more profitable than killing them:

## The 6-Step Process: From $27 Billion to Curing Cancer

**1. Get the Money**: The **[1% Treaty](./1-percent-treaty.md)** redirects $27B/year from weapons to cures  
**2. Allocate Efficiently**: The **[DIH](./dih.md)** uses democratic voting to fund what matters most  
**3. Pay Patients**: Subsidies go directly to patients who join trials  
**4. Run Cheap Trials**: Pragmatic trials cost $500/patient instead of $41,000  
**5. Publish Everything**: The **[dFDA](./dfda.md)** shows real effectiveness data for every treatment  
**6. Label Outcomes**: Every food and drug gets honest labels about what it actually does  

**Result**: We know what works, what doesn't, and people get paid to help figure it out.

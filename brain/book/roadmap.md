# ðŸ“– Chapter 11: Roadmap - Timeline to Global Impact

Here's how we go from a plan to a $27 billion annual budget in 3-5 years.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Seed & Foundation (Months 0-3)

**Goal:** To establish the core legal and financial structure and hire the "activation team" required to execute the main capital raise and global campaign.

- **Fundraising:** Raise a **$1M-$3M pre-seed round** to fund salaries and initial operations.
- **Legal:** Incorporate the initial for-profit management company and non-profit foundation.
- **Hiring:** Recruit the three core leads for the activation team:
- [Capital Markets Lead](./careers/capital-markets-lead.md)
- Elections & IE Compliance Lead
- Growth & Referrals Lead

---

## Phase 1: Seed Round & Infrastructure (Months 4-12)

**Goal:** With a core team and seed funding in place, build the full legal, financial, and technical infrastructure required for the global campaign in 5 pilot countries.

- **Fundraising:** Secure a **$250M - $400M seed round**.
- **Team Expansion:** Recruit foundational leadership (CEO, COO, CTO, General Counsel) and heads of Product, Design, and Political Strategy (Headcount: ~20).
- **Platform Development:** Build and deploy V1 of the global referendum platform, referral engine, and impact calculators.
- **Legal & Financial:** Formalize treasury management, finalize tokenomics for VICTORY instruments, and draft model legislation for pilot countries.
- **Unlock Gate:** Secure **50 million verified referendum participants**.

---

## Phase 2: Series A & Political Mobilization (Months 13-24)

**Goal:** To expand political operations to all G7 nations, achieve the 3.5% global participation threshold, and secure the first binding national commitments.

- **Fundraising:** Secure a **$500M - $1B Series A round**.
- **Team Expansion:** Scale the team to support a full-scale political operation, including regional campaign directors and a Head of Security (Headcount: ~50-75).
- **Global Referendum:** Execute the campaign to secure **3.5% global participation** (280M+ votes).
- **Political Action:** Begin the first major independent expenditure cycles in priority elections.
- **Unlock Gate:** Achieve the **3.5% participation threshold** and/or secure the **first national treaty commitment from a G7 nation**.

---

## Phase 3: Growth Round & Treaty Ratification (Months 25-48)

**Goal:** To ensure treaty ratification in all major powers (US, EU, China), fully capitalize the DIH treasury, and begin delivering returns to investors.

- **Fundraising:** Secure a **$500M - $1.1B growth round**.
- **Team Expansion:** Transition to a "Protocol Team" focused on treasury management, compliance, and decentralized governance (Headcount: ~75-100).
- **Activate the DIH Treasury:** Begin receiving the **$27B+ annual revenue stream** from signatory nations.
- **Deliver Investor Returns:** Repay VICTORY Bond holders with a superior return, fulfilling the core financial promise.
- **Unlock Gate:** First treaty ratification by a major power.

---

## Phase 4: The Endgame (Years 4+)

**Goal:** With the 1% Treaty established, begin the multi-generational strategy to systematically phase out war by incrementally increasing the redirected percentage.

- **Full Operational Deployment:** The DIH is a fully-funded, self-sustaining global institution.
- **Fund Global Public Goods:** Deploy treasury funds to high-impact initiatives, with a primary focus on subsidizing patient participation in **[80X more efficient](./proof.md)** decentralized clinical trials.
- **Incremental Referendums:** After a successful proof-of-concept period, initiate global referendums for incremental increases to the redirection (e.g., to 1.5%, then 2%), creating a perpetual flywheel for peace and prosperity.

---

## Summary: Key Gates & Metrics

- **Gate 1:** 100M referendum participants.
- **Gate 2:** First $500M independent expenditure cycle.
- **Gate 3:** First national treaty ratification.
- **Gate 4:** First $1B disbursement from the DIH Treasury.

## Appendix: Implementation Details

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Build global referendum platform; secure initial $250M financing tranche; launch in 5 pilot countries.

**Phase 2 (Months 12-24):** Achieve 3.5% global participation; begin independent expenditures in priority elections; first binding referendum votes.

**Phase 3 (Months 24-36):** Secure first national treaty commitments; establish DIH treasury operations; begin giving money to universities and companies.

**Phase 4 (Months 36-48):** Scale to major powers (US, EU, China); achieve $27B+ annual inflows; full operational deployment.

**Phase 5 (Years 4+):** Begin the multi-generational endgame. After a successful proof-of-concept period, initiate referendums for incremental increases to the redirection (e.g., to 1.5%, then 2%), creating a perpetual flywheel for peace. For details, see [The Endgame: A Multi-Generational Strategy to Phase Out War](./strategy/the-endgame-phasing-out-war.md).

**Key Gates:** 100M referendum participants â†’ first $500M independent expenditure cycle â†’ first treaty ratification â†’ first $1B disbursement.

### Risks and Mitigations

**Cheating/Holdouts:** Start with coalitions of willing nations; use massive personal financial incentives targeting individual leaders in holdout nations - campaign support, personal investment opportunities in VICTORY bonds, and targeted independent expenditures against treaty opponents.

**Capture/Corruption:** Transparent, algorithmic allocation based on verifiable health outcomes; independent audits funded by bounties.

**Legal Challenges:** Multi-jurisdiction compliance from Day 1; constitutional scholars on advisory board; structured as treaty obligations, not domestic mandates.

**Timeline Risk:** Phased approach with clear gates; early wins in smaller countries build momentum for major powers.

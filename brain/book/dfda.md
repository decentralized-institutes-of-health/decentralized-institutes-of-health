# ðŸ“– Chapter 3: A Decentralized Autonomous FDA

The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is the treasury. The **Decentralized FDA (dFDA)** is the engine it funds.

The dFDA is not a new government bureaucracy or a single software application. It is an **open-source, decentralized protocol** for clinical research designed to be **[80 times more efficient](./reference/recovery-trial.md)** than the current system. Its purpose is to define the rules and standards that allow a competitive ecosystem of companies, universities, and patient groups to conduct research faster, cheaper, and more transparently.

This chapter outlines the vision for this new engine of medical progress.

# ðŸ“– Chapter 7: How We Build This Thing

We're not building a normal company. We're building a small team to get this started, then making ourselves obsolete.

## The Plan: Start Small, Then Disappear

We'll hire a few very smart people to build the system, then get out of the way.

Here's how we split the work:

- **Core Team:** A few people handle strategy, politics, legal stuff, and the big picture.
- **Everything Else:** We hire contractors, agencies, and eventually pay the community to do the actual work.

We win when the system works without us.

## How We Pay People

We pay modest salaries plus a big stake in the outcome.

- **Salaries:** Enough to live on, but not crazy money.
- **Equity:** Big grants of **[VICTORY instruments](./economics.md)** that pay off when we win.

This way, the team gets rich when the mission succeeds, not when they negotiate better salaries.

## Who We Hire and When

We start with three people, then scale up as we hit milestones.

### Phase 0: The First Three People (Months 0-3)

**Goal:** Get the core team together and raise the first round of money.

- **Money Person:** Structure the VICTORY bonds, build the financial models, and raise money from investors.
- **Legal/Political Person:** Design the legal framework for the global referendum and figure out how to run political campaigns in different countries without going to prison.
- **Growth Person:** Build the platform where people vote and get rewards, and make it spread like wildfire.

### Phase 1: Twenty People (Months 4-12)

**Goal:** Raise serious money and build the platform.

Get the standard startup leadership team: CEO, COO, CTO, lawyers, and heads of product, design, community, and politics.

### Phase 2: Fifty to Seventy-Five People (Months 13-24)

**Goal:** Run the global referendum and political campaigns.

Add security, data science, more engineers, and political operatives.

### Phase 3: Seventy-Five to One Hundred People (Years 3+)

**Goal:** Manage the $27 billion treasury.

Add CFO, compliance officers, and people who know how to run a massive budget without stealing.

The idea is to start small, scale fast when we need to, then stabilize once the money starts flowing.

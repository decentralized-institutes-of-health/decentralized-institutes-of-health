# The Cost of a Nuclear Bomb vs. The Cost of a Human Life

This analysis calculates the cost per death for a modern nuclear weapon and uses that figure to estimate the potential human cost of a $2.69 trillion military budget—the amount that would remain *after* redirecting 1% to health research as proposed by the 1% Treaty.

## I. Cost of a Modern Nuclear Weapon

The cost of a single nuclear warhead is difficult to pinpoint, as it is often bundled into larger modernization and delivery system programs. However, we can use the **B61-12 Life Extension Program** as a credible benchmark.

- **Unit Cost:** The B61-12 bomb has an estimated unit cost of **$27.5 million**.
- **Program Cost:** The total program cost for 400-500 bombs is estimated at **$11 billion**.

For this analysis, we will use the conservative unit cost of **$27.5 million** per bomb.

## II. Estimated Casualties from a Nuclear Detonation

The number of deaths from a nuclear detonation depends on the weapon's yield, the population density of the target, and whether it is an airburst or ground burst. Modern strategic warheads are many times more powerful than the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

A widely used tool for modeling these effects is NUKEMAP, created by historian of science Alex Wellerstein. A simulation of a single, modern 300-kiloton W87 warhead detonated over a dense urban center like Manhattan reveals a catastrophic scale of destruction.

- **Estimated Fatalities:** A surface blast is projected to cause approximately **1,619,570 fatalities**.

This figure includes immediate deaths from the blast, heat, and initial radiation, but does not account for long-term deaths from fallout, disease, or the collapse of medical infrastructure.

## III. Calculation: The Cost Per Death

Using these figures, we can calculate the approximate cost to kill one person with a nuclear weapon.

- **Cost per Bomb:** \$27,500,000
- **Deaths per Bomb:** 1,619,570
- **Cost per Death:** $27,500,000 / 1,619,570 = **~$16.98 per person**

This means that for the price of a cup of coffee, our current military apparatus can kill one person.

## IV. The Human Cost of a $2.69 Trillion Budget

If 1% of the global military budget were redirected, $2.69 trillion would remain. We can now calculate the potential human cost of that remaining budget.

1.  **Number of Bombs:**
    -   $2,690,000,000,000 / $27,500,000 per bomb = **97,818 bombs**

2.  **Total Potential Deaths:**
    -   97,818 bombs * 1,619,570 deaths per bomb = **~158,421,000,000 people**

With the $2.69 trillion left over after funding the War on Disease, global military spending could still theoretically purchase enough nuclear weapons to kill **158.4 billion people**, or approximately **20 times the entire population of Earth.**

This calculation highlights the grotesque inefficiency and overkill capacity of the current global military apparatus.

# Pragmatic vs Explanatory Trials: A Quantitative Analysis

## What are Pragmatic Trials?

Pragmatic trials are designed to test interventions in real-world conditions, focusing on:

- **Real-world effectiveness** rather than controlled efficacy
- **Broad patient populations** with minimal exclusion criteria
- **Routine clinical settings** rather than specialized research environments
- **Practical outcomes** that matter to patients and clinicians
- **Rapid implementation** of findings into clinical practice

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Metric               | Pragmatic Trials (e.g., RECOVERY)    | Traditional Explanatory Trials                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost per Trial       | Lower due to existing infrastructure | [$48-225 million](https://www.anjusoftware.com/insights/eclinical/clinical-trial-costs/)            |
| Time to Results      | Weeks to months                      | [5-7 years average](https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research) |
| Participants         | Large (e.g., 47,000+ in RECOVERY)    | [Typically 500-3000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6248200/)                         |
| Implementation Speed | Hours to days                        | Months to years                                                                                     |
| Patient Population   | Diverse, real-world                  | Highly selected                                                                                     |
| Setting              | Routine clinical practice            | Specialized research centers                                                                        |
| Generalizability     | High                                 | Limited                                                                                             |

## Cost Analysis

### Traditional Explanatory Trials

- Average phase costs ([source](https://www.sofpromed.com/how-much-does-a-clinical-trial-cost)):
  - Phase 1: $4 million
  - Phase 2: $13 million
  - Phase 3: $20 million
- Per-patient costs vary by therapeutic area:
  - Blood disorders: $200,000-422,000
  - [Average across areas: $41,117](../book/references.md#trial-costs-fda-study)

### Pragmatic Trials (RECOVERY Example)

- [Cost savings of 68-78% compared to traditional trials](../book/references.md#pmc-trial-economics)
- Utilized existing healthcare infrastructure
- Minimal additional staff costs
- Reduced monitoring costs
- Simple data collection systems

## Speed and Efficiency

### RECOVERY Trial Metrics

- [9 days: Concept to first patient enrollment](../book/references.md#recovery-trial-dexamethasone-results)
- [10 weeks: First life-saving treatment identified](../book/references.md#landray-recovery-trial-quote)
- [3 hours: Results to policy implementation](../book/references.md#landray-recovery-trial-quote)
- [47,000+ participants across 6 countries](../book/references.md#recovery-trial-summary-quote)
- [200+ hospital sites](../book/references.md#recovery-trial-summary-quote)
- [10 major results obtained](../book/references.md#recovery-trial-summary-quote)
- [4 effective COVID-19 treatments identified](../book/references.md#recovery-trial-summary-quote)

### Traditional Trial Metrics

- Average time from phase 1 to approval: [7.2 years](https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/legacy/bioorg/docs/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf)
- [80% of trials fail to meet enrollment timelines](../book/references.md#clinical-trial-enrollment-timelines)
- [Up to 50% of research sites enroll one or no patients](../book/references.md#clinical-trial-enrollment-timelines)

## Clinical Impact

### RECOVERY Trial

- [Dexamethasone findings](../book/references.md#recovery-trial-dexamethasone-results):
  - 35% reduction in mortality for ventilated patients
  - [Estimated 1 million lives saved globally](../book/references.md#recovery-trial-summary-quote)
- Implementation within hours of results
- Real-world effectiveness immediately apparent

### Traditional Trials

- [14% success rate from phase 1 to approval](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092479/)
- Average 7 years from discovery to clinical practice
- Limited real-world applicability due to strict inclusion criteria

## Advantages of Pragmatic Trials

1. **Better Generalizability**
   - Results apply to broader patient populations
   - Findings directly relevant to routine clinical practice
   - Higher external validity

2. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Uses existing healthcare infrastructure
   - Lower per-patient costs
   - Faster recruitment and completion

3. **Implementation Speed**
   - Rapid translation to clinical practice
   - Immediate real-world validation
   - Reduced lag between evidence and practice

4. **Statistical Power**
   - Larger sample sizes possible
   - More diverse patient populations
   - Better representation of real-world outcomes

# Hiring Plan & Team Roadmap

## The Philosophy: A Lean Activation Team

This document outlines the structure of the temporary "activation team"â€”the small, core group of strategic leaders required to bootstrap the DIH. Our goal is not to build a large, permanent organization. It is to assemble an elite team whose sole function is to build a self-sustaining protocol and then make themselves obsolete.

To achieve this, we distinguish between core strategic functions and tactical execution:

- **Core Functions (Internal Team):** Strategy, leadership, political maneuvering, legal architecture, and product vision are handled by the small, core team. This is the permanent brain trust.
- **Tactical Execution (Outsourced):** Functions like software development, specialized quantitative analysis, and media production will be outsourced to world-class agencies and contractors. This provides flexibility and access to elite talent without building a large, permanent bureaucracy.

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the team structure and hiring roadmap, justifying the headcount figures presented in the [Operational Budget & Financial Model](../economic-models/operational-budget-and-financial-model.md). Our structure is a hybrid model informed by a detailed analysis of successful precedents, including The Global Fund, the ICBL, and MakerDAO. For a full breakdown, see [**Organizational Precedents & Staffing Models**](../reference/organizational-precedents.md).

Our strategy is to build a lean, world-class core team for direct execution and to aggressively leverage contractors, prize-based competitions, and partner organizations to scale our impact without a large, bureaucratic overhead.

## Compensation Philosophy

All core team members will receive modest, market-rate cash salaries combined with large, vested grants of VICTORY bonds. This approach preserves cash for high-leverage political and technical spending while deeply aligning the team's long-term financial success with the success of the mission.

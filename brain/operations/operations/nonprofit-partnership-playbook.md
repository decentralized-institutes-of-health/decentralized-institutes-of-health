# Playbook: Non-Profit Partnership

## Guiding Principle: Building a Coalition of Grant-Makers

This playbook outlines the process for recruiting and coordinating with non-profit partners. The core strategy is to build a powerful coalition by aligning their long-term interests with our own.

The goal is to reframe the dynamic: we are not asking for help or offering one-time grants. We are offering our partners a credible path to becoming permanent grant-makers themselves by unlocking a multi-billion-dollar treasury dedicated to our shared mission.

## The Partnership Engagement Process

This is a formal, three-step process for bringing new non-profit partners into the coalition.

### Step 1: The Strategic Pitch

This is the initial meeting to inspire the partner and align them with the core vision.

**Agenda:**

1.  **Acknowledge the Shared Problem (The "Weak Stick"):** Start by identifying the common enemy: the fragmented, scarcity-based, competitive grant system. Explain that this is _why_ progress is slow. It's spread so thinly that it guarantees competition, not collaboration. It forces a fight for scraps while the unified, multi-trillion-dollar military-industrial complex lobbies as a single bloc.

2.  **Introduce the Systemic Solution (Enlarging the Pie):** Frame The 1% Treaty as the mechanism to stop fighting over a small, shrinking pie and instead work together to bake a much larger one. This solution has three layers:
    - **A Bigger Pie (The Prize):** Create a new, permanent \$27B+ annual treasury, increasing the entire sector's revenue by over 60%.
    - **Your Slice of the Pie (The Incentive):** Earn a permanent, proportional governance stake in that future treasury. Your share is determined by your verified contributions to the coalition's success via a transparent **["contribute-to-earn"](../community/nonprofit-partnership-incentives.md)** model. As an immediate benefit, you also retain 10% of all donations you raise for unrestricted use.
    - **A Better Pie (The Platform):** Build a shared, open-source operational backend for all coalition partners. This eliminates duplicated administrative work and ensures more funding goes directly to research, not overhead.
      > _"We have all been fighting for scraps from a tiny pie. The 1% Treaty is the plan to stop fighting over crumbs and work together to bake a new, much larger oneâ€”a permanent, \$27B+ annual treasury for our shared cause. This is our collective path from being grant-seekers to grant-makers."_

3.  **Define the Immediate Barrier:** Clearly state the immediate, mission-critical priority that stands in the way of launching the main campaign.
    > _"The single biggest obstacle to getting the seed funding we need to launch this campaign is the professional quality of our core strategic documents. We need to look like a billion-dollar operation before we can ask for billion-dollar checks. This is our immediate, collective priority."_

### Step 2: The Tactical "Ask" (The First Contribution)

Once the strategic alignment is established, define a concrete, high-value first contribution. This anchors the partnership in tangible work, not just talk.

1.  **Present a Professional Plan:** Introduce a specific, well-defined project that is critical to the next milestone.

    > _"To that end, our primary focus for the next quarter is the execution of a comprehensive restructuring of our core strategic wiki. We have a detailed, professional project plan ready for execution: the [Wiki Restructuring Plan](./wiki-restructuring-plan.md)."_

2.  **Frame Their Role as a Strategic Investment:** Position their contribution not as "help," but as the most strategic investment of their resources they can make.
    > _"As a foundational partner in this coalition, the single most valuable contribution you can make right now is to help us execute this plan. By lending your organization's talent to this effort, you are directly accelerating the timeline to unlock our permanent funding."_

### Step 3: Coordinated Execution

Treat the partnership as a formal project with clear ownership and accountability.

- **Assign Leads:** Based on the partner's skills and capacity, collaboratively assign a "Project Lead" for the joint effort.
- **Establish a Cadence:** Set up a regular, brief check-in (e.g., weekly 30 minutes) to track progress against the plan.
- **Maintain a Professional Frame:** Consistently reinforce that this is a professional collaboration between strategic partners, not an informal volunteer effort. This respects everyone's time and ensures a high-quality outcome.

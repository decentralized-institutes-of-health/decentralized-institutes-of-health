## The Decentralized FDA Act (dFDA)

**A Law to Democratize and Revolutionize Food and Drug Evaluation for Global Benefit**

**Preamble:**

Recognizing that the current system for evaluating the safety and efficacy of foods and drugs is slow, expensive, geographically limited, and often opaque, hindering scientific progress and delaying access to potentially life-saving treatments and beneficial dietary interventions;

Acknowledging the immense potential of open science, decentralized technologies, algorithmic analysis, and global collaboration to accelerate discovery, improve public health, and empower individuals to participate in the scientific process;

Affirming the fundamental right of every person to access and participate in scientific research relevant to their health and well-being, regardless of location, socioeconomic status, or institutional affiliation;

Desiring to transform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website, fda.gov, into a global public good, fostering transparency, accelerating innovation, and drastically reducing the cost and time associated with food and drug evaluation;

**Therefore, be it enacted by the [Legislative Body, e.g., Congress of the United States]:**

**Section 1: Short Title**

This Act may be cited as the "Decentralized FDA Act" or "dFDA Act."

**Section 2: Findings and Purpose**

The [Legislative Body] finds and declares that:

**(a) The Current System is Inadequate:** The existing regulatory framework for food and drug evaluation, while intended to protect public health, suffers from inefficiencies, high costs, limited patient access, and barriers to innovation.

**(b) Open Science is Essential:** Open access to data, methodologies, and results is crucial for accelerating scientific progress and ensuring public trust in food and drug evaluation.

**(c) Decentralization and Automation are Transformative:** Decentralized technologies and algorithmic automation can dramatically reduce costs, increase efficiency, and democratize participation in clinical and dietary trials.

**(d) Global Collaboration is Necessary:** Health challenges are global, and solutions require international collaboration and data sharing.

**(e) Patient Empowerment is Paramount:** Individuals have the right to understand and participate in research that affects their health and well-being.

**(f) Cost Reduction is Critical:** The exorbitant cost of traditional trials prevents timely access to beneficial interventions and disproportionately burdens patients and healthcare systems.

**(g) Comprehensive Data is Needed:** A holistic understanding of the effects of foods and drugs, including subtle and long-term effects, requires continuous and comprehensive data collection.

**(h) FDA.gov as a Global Platform:**  FDA.gov, as a readily accessible and recognized domain, can serve as the foundation for a global open-source platform for food and drug evaluation.

The purpose of this Act is to:

**(1) Transform fda.gov into the Decentralized FDA Platform (dFDA Platform).**

**(2) Establish an FDA-X Prize to incentivize the creation of a fully functional, open-source, automated, algorithmic, and decentralized trial platform.**

**(3) Guarantee the right of every person globally to participate in any trial listed on the dFDA Platform.**

**(4) Empower anyone to create and conduct trials on the dFDA Platform, subject to ethical and data integrity standards.**

**(5) Mandate the comprehensive quantification of all effects of all foods and drugs through continuous data collection and analysis on the dFDA Platform.**

**(6) Repeal or amend any existing legislation that conflicts with the establishment and operation of the dFDA Platform and the achievement of its goals.**

**(7) Achieve a minimum 80X reduction in the per-patient cost of food and drug trials through the implementation of the dFDA Platform.**

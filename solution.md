# ðŸ“– Chapter 2: Legal Bribery for Peace

The solution to our grotesque misallocation of resources is not complicated. It does not require a complete reinvention of human nature. It requires a simple, logical, and globally coordinated act of rational self-interest.

We propose **The 1% Treaty**: A binding global accord for every nation to redirect 1% of its annual military budget to a shared, open-source protocol for curing disease.

This is not charity. It is a direct upgrade to our model of global security and a massive investment in human and economic potential.

## The Simple Logic of Mutual Survival

The case for the 1% Treaty rests on an irrefutable logical proof:

1.  Governments spend over **$2 trillion per year on military force** to maintain a balance of power against other nations. The primary goal is to avoid being attacked.
2.  If every nation simultaneously reduces its military budget by 1% and contributes that amount to a global fund, **the relative balance of power remains identical**. No nation becomes weaker relative to its rivals.
3.  Therefore, with no change in relative military risk, every nation on Earth gains access to a massive, perpetually funded engine for biomedical innovation that will cure the diseases afflicting their own citizens.

It is the single most rational and highest-leverage action humanity can take.

## How It Works: An Engine for Curing Disease

This plan is executed through a new global organization with a transparent, decentralized, and auditable structure.

**1. The 1% Treaty Funds the DIH:**
- Every participating nation pledges 1% of its annual military budget to the **Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)**, a non-profit, globally-governed SuperDAO.
- This creates a sustainable, **[$27+ billion annual treasury](./economics.md)** dedicated to funding public health solutions.

**2. The DIH is Governed by Wishocracy:**
- The DIH's budget and research agenda are managed using the **[Wishocracy governance protocol](./governance.md)**.
- This allows millions of stakeholders to democratically and efficiently allocate capital to the most promising research without being dominated by special interests.

**3. A Hyper-Efficient & Open-Source R&D Model:**
- The DIH funds a new clinical trial ecosystem that is **[80X more efficient](./proof.md)** than the current model.
- All research data and findings are made **open-source and available in real-time** to the entire global scientific community, eliminating waste and accelerating progress.

**4. A "Coalition of Coalitions" Structure:**
- The DIH is not a single, top-down bureaucracy. It is a SuperDAO that delegates authority to a network of specialized, subordinate DAOs (subDAOs).
- Each subDAO focuses on a specific area of health, such as the **Decentralized Cancer Institute** or the **Decentralized Institute on Aging**.
- Governance of each subDAO is delegated to a coalition of the most effective non-profits, patient advocacy groups, and research institutions in that field, ensuring that funding decisions are made by true experts and stakeholders.

**5. VICTORY Bonds Kickstart the Process:**
- To begin immediately, the DIH will be initially capitalized by selling **VICTORY Bonds** to the public, institutions, and even nations.
- These bonds allow research and development to start now, with the revenue from the 1% Treaty used to repay bondholders over time, ensuring a sustainable financial cycle.

This is a complete, end-to-end system that makes curing people more profitable and prestigious than killing them.

## A New Definition of National Security

By turning humanity's competitive drive away from destruction and towards healing, we create a world that is not only healthier but fundamentally safer.

-   **Planetary Defense Against Pandemics:** A globally funded, always-on research network is the ultimate defense against the existential threat of natural or engineered pandemics.
-   **Strengthening Nations from Within:** A nation's true strength is the health and productivity of its people. Curing diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and diabetes strengthens national economies, reduces social instability, and prevents the internal conflicts that often spill across borders.
-   **Reducing the Capacity for War:** A 1% reduction in military spending is a direct 1% reduction in the resources available for conflict. It is a tangible step away from mutually assured destruction and towards mutually assured survival.

This is how we capture the peace dividend and build a future where our greatest collective achievements are not weapons of war, but cures for disease.

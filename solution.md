# The Solution: Legal Bribery for Peace

As outlined in the introduction, moral arguments against war and disease have consistently failed because they cannot overcome the powerful financial incentives that perpetuate the status quo.

Our solution does not repeat this mistake. It is engineered to win by offering every stakeholder—from citizens and politicians to the military-industrial complex itself—a mathematically superior financial deal. We will not persuade; we will pay. We call this **Peace Profiteering**.

This document is the blueprint for that new system. It outlines the vision, the core principles, and the phased implementation plan for building a world where curing people is more profitable than killing them.

## The Core Strategy: A 5-Point Blueprint

Our path to a world without disease is based on five simple, powerful principles:

1.  **Collect Data on What Works Best:** Build a simple, trusted global database—the **Decentralized FDA (dFDA)**—that shows which treatments and habits improve health the most. Make it easy for anyone to contribute and see clear, honest rankings.
2.  **Let People Choose:** Empower patients with data. Grant them a **Universal Right to Trial** for any treatment that has passed basic safety tests, let them see the best-ranked options, and allow them to report back on their results. Good treatments rise to the top; ineffective ones fade away.
3.  **Make Cures Profitable:** Shift the economic incentives. If a new therapy saves billions in healthcare costs by preventing or curing a disease, share the savings with its creators. Our **[Health Savings Sharing Model](./economics/health-savings-sharing-model.md)** ensures that cures are orders of magnitude more profitable than chronic treatments.
4.  **Build a Global Mandate:** This is not a top-down mandate. We will ask the world's citizens to refine, support, and vote on this plan in a **Global Referendum**. Achieving the **[3.5% Tipping Point](./README.md#3-5-rule)** of public support gives us the unstoppable moral and political authority to act.
5.  **Capture the Peace Dividend:** Create a new funding engine—The **Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)**—powered by a **1% redirection of global military spending** secured by the **[1% Treaty](./strategy/1-percent-treaty.md)**. This treasury will be governed by the community to fund the most promising research, transparently and without bias.

## The 5-Phase Implementation Framework

This progression creates a logical, transparent sequence from a shared vision to worldwide realization.

### Phase 1: Define the Ideal (The Blueprint)
This document is the blueprint. It defines the destination: a world with a Global Decentralized FDA (dFDA) for real-time data analysis, a Universal Right to Trial for all patients, and Optimized Incentives that make curing disease the primary economic driver of healthcare.

### Phase 2: Chart the Path (The Roadmap)
The [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) details the step-by-step plan to build the infrastructure, transform the incentive structures, and achieve global implementation. It is a practical guide from today's broken system to the future we envision.

### Phase 3: Mobilize the 3.5% (The Global Referendum)
We will put the plan to a worldwide vote. A global referendum gives every citizen a voice, granting the moral and political authority to move forward. With a clear mandate, policymakers can no longer ignore the will of the people.

### Phase 4: Lock in the Wins (The 1% Treaty & The Act)
With overwhelming global support, we will work to pass the **1% Treaty** and a supporting **Disease Eradication Act**—a legal framework that formalizes the reforms, incentives, and institutions required to implement the roadmap. This locks in the structure for a new global health ecosystem.

### Phase 5: Build the Engine (The DIH & The War on Disease)
This is where the vision becomes reality. The implementation of this blueprint is powered by an aggressive, pragmatic, and actionable strategy detailed in [strategy.md](./strategy.md).

This strategy details the creation of the **Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)**, a democratically-controlled treasury funded by the 1% redirection. It outlines the specific mechanisms—from VICTORY bonds to "legal bribes"—to align the world's political and economic systems with the goal of human health and survival.

## The Endgame: A Self-Sustaining Protocol
The ultimate goal of this blueprint is to create a system that no longer requires a core team to operate. The five phases are designed to build and bootstrap a self-sustaining public utility that runs on two core engines:

1.  **Automated Economic Incentives:** A protocol, like MakerDAO, that aligns the financial self-interest of all participants with the public good.
2.  **Intrinsic Human Motivation:** A global community, like Wikipedia's, that is intrinsically motivated to contribute to and govern a shared resource for humanity.

The core team described in the [Hiring Plan](./operations/hiring-plan.md) is the temporary scaffolding required to build this institution. Their mission is to architect the protocol, win the initial political battles, and catalyze the community. Once the DIH is fully operational and governed by its token holders, the scaffolding is removed. The team's ultimate measure of success is making itself obsolete.
